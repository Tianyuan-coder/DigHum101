UT sublet/roommate finder page- https://www.facebook.com/groups/UTSubletRoommateFinder/

Many students prefer to live in West Campus or North Campus, which are residential areas that are west and north of campus respectively. West Campus is full of apartments while North Campus consists apartments, condos, and houses. Both of these areas are fairly close to campus, and you can walk or take a bus from these areas to get to UT. However, apartments/condos in North Campus tend to be a little farther from UT than apartments in West Campus. A little further south is Riverside, which is another area that is popular with students. It's about 3 miles away from campus and you'll probably have to take the bus or bike if you live there.

In terms of rent, apartments in West Campus can be pretty expensive, and rent can be anywhere from $800-$1500/month per room depending on the apartment complex. As a result, many students in West Campus choose to share a room, which would cut your rent in half. Renting a room in North Campus is usually  more affordable as it is slightly farther away and I've heard of people finding rooms for $700/month. Rent in Riverside is even lower, and I've seen rooms going for as low as $500 a month. 

These are the three residential areas near UT that I'm most familiar with. I'm sure there are plenty of other apartments/condos near UT that have great places to live.

65,"The wall jack connects to a network switch managed by UT ITS, but that doesn't mean that you have full access to devices that connect to that same switch. More likely, traffic is segmented for network drops to dorm rooms from the wireless access point traffic, so your wall jack traffic will probably only be able to access UT internal services hosted on-prem, printers across the campus, things like that. There are a lot of rules in the network that dictate what your traffic can and cannot access thanks to Routers and Firewalls across the campus, and I'm fairly confident that WAPs are completely segmented and belong in the category of ""never should be able to access from the wall jack network"" because the likelihood of someone needing to connect to an endpoint on the wifi from their wall jack is very slim and more than likely malicious. I realize that Hue bulbs are not malicious in themselves, but the overhead required to make access to Hue bridges and bulbs work would not be a good use of ITS's time, and might open up the UT network to security issues.     

Because these rules are in place, devices plugged into the wall jack cannot access devices connected to wifi, unless you make your own wireless network with your own consumer-grade router that basically bypasses UT's network infrastructure. This is part of the reason why UT dorms ban personal wifi networks because they bypass security mechanisms in place for the safety of devices connected to UT's network, and also because personal wifi networks can interfere with existing wifi network broadcasts, causing issues to your neighbors that just want to use UT's wifi as normal end-users.",0.042,0.3773,0.5807

212,"Hey i've done DRP a couple of times. It is not too difficult to get in, but you seem early in your math career so you may not get in your first time, depending on what you've taken. They generally want you to have at least gotten linear algebra out of the way, for example. However, you should apply no matter what because being accepted depends solely on if a grad student wants to mentor you, which can happen regardless of your level or anything else really. The experience is very individualized. Essentially you get matched with your grad student and then the DRP organization says ok, do whatever you guys want. So you come to an agreement with your mentor on what you want to happen. I think the norm is that you pick something to read in the first week, then you read a little bit every week and meet once or twice a week. The guideline is 4 hours of work a week, but it was always more than that for me. it depends on what you and your mentor decide. No required classes, no institutional programs that are similar to this except for maybe the summer mini courses which are mainly aimed at grad students so you shouldn't worry about that yet. It's not what the other person said at all. DRP is not research, and it's only dry if you make it so.",0.1787,0.6961,0.1252

259,"If it were me, I would go with 3 years, however I don’t know how this would affect getting into grad school(because I choose to quit school at the end of my undergrad).

Most employers in CS don’t care AT ALL about fancy math. I took math as my supporting coursework(more hours than a minor, less than a major) and I only had 1 employer that I talked to even consider it a plus(still didn’t get that job). All the other ones I talked with or interviewed with didn’t even bat an eye. The software developer job I work now involves no advanced math at all. I will soon be completely forgetting cal 1+2+3, linear 1+2, probability, population dynamics and more. My point is that if you want to go into software development, it is highly unlikely that a second major will have any value at all in terms of finding employment. It is possible though if you are really looking hard for a very niche job.

You have a long time to decide whether you want to go to grad school. Many people who go in planning on grad school  often don’t. Also many people who never considered grad school decide to go as the application deadline approaches.

You likely know that grad school is not a necessity for making a living as a CS Major. I graduated a few months ago with a CS undergrad and I’m making (what I think is pretty normal for a fresh grad in CS) $70k/year as a junior developer.

Comp Sci would be a better fit imo, but computer engineering isn't the worst possible major as the data science track could possibly offer something along the lines that you're looking at (not sure yet as I'm only an incoming freshman). But from my experience, Engineering Honors does give out generous scholarships (I personally received a $14,000/yr scholarship with top 5% class rank and a 1570 SAT) but I'm not too sure about CS; International will be much more competitive however and I haven't heard much about the CS department giving out generous merit scholarships. 

Final note: There's a rubric on how to get into Engineering Honors (I have to look for the link and will edit my response) but they award points based on class rank and SAT score and then award points for a combo of EC's and awards; an overall score of 21+ should get you into honors and if you have more points and demonstrate need there is a good chance you may get a scholarship (although international students might be different)",0.3262,0.5432,0.1306

.10/.20 Small Stakes Weekly Game w/ professional volunteer dealer - NO RAKE OR FEES, friendly game

Hi, I'm looking to consolidate all of the local UT for fun poker players into one professional game that observes casino rules, uses standard ceramic chips, and have a dedicated volunteer dealer. I've personally trained a few dealers that ended up working for the local card houses so we'll be in good hands. Overtime, if everyone wants to unanimously raise the stakes that might be an option. Traditionally we've been playing 5/10 to 25/50 cents depending on who all shows up the day of the game and peak at 2 tables during the fall semester.

701 W 28th St

Austin, TX 78705

see picture of street view, easy to find or text 512 584 1262 for clarification

TLDR

\-Local friendly stakes game full of UT students and alumni

\-we do use standard casino chip colors and enforce casino rules, like no splashing the pot

\-use Venmo for buyin/cashout

\-at the SW corner of 28th and Rio Grande, text 512 584 1262 for us to let you in

398,"I took Shabbir for Ochem 1 last fall, and I would say she did a pretty good job. Definitely take advantage of all of her office hours and the office hours of other TAs. There's a lot of TAs, so I would suggest going to all of their office hours to see who you vibe with the most. I would also recommend taking advantage of those free tutoring credits you get with the Sanger Learning Center in Jester as they were super helpful in helping me figure out homework problems and other tough concepts from class.

I think the workload is manageable, and as long as you're looking over the homework in advance and taking the time to re-write notes, go back over lectures, do extra problems, etc... I think you should be fine. The material is dense and requires a good amount of time to memorize and understand on your part, so if you start to fall behind it'll be difficult to catch up. The midterms weren't extremely difficult, but they did start getting brutal towards the middle to end of the semester. Highly recommend re-writing homework questions and re-writing mechanisms over and over again until you get them because very similar questions tend to pop up on the midterms, and also skim over topics from previous units just in case she decides to add them in. The final was pretty hard from what I remember, but if you've been taking opportunities to seek out help and understand important reactions/concepts/mechanisms you'll do just fine.  


TL;DR: Good professor for Ochem 1, doable workload. Go to office hours/Sanger Center, do work ahead of time and do extra work when you can. Exams were okay but they kind of suck towards the end of the semester. Don't slack, memorize/understand concepts and you'll do fine.",0.7496,0.2133,0.0371

If you major in an engineering field (for example), taking out a loan is a lot better than working during classes. Even if you only work 10 hours a week, you'll find your grades suffering from distraction and lost time. If you truly are paying for college down the road with these hours (I doubt you are if its only 10 hours) youre going to be spending more time anyways managing your finances properly. On top of that, let's say you drop from a 3.6 GPA to a 3.2 because you were working during school. Even if it cost you 100k, youre going to make that value back within 5 years and youre going to get better jobs open up because of the higher GPA meaning a higher pay start.

I would seriously recommend removing any distractions from college sich as work. If you need pocket cash, you can easily only work weekends, but you should recognize that the 4 hours of studying per hour of class is not an exaggeration and you will feel the effect od being pulled away from classes even if its mindless corporation drone work.

They are an incredible group of people that (more often than not) truly want you to learn and understand. I always felt like the neuroscience faculty were the most attentive in comparison to biology and chemistry. 

If you do choose to major in neuroscience, you should do a BS. A BSA requires a lot fewer neuro courses and the faculty talk shit about the BSA option regularly. 

Take tons of lab courses. These are easily the most fun and the best learning experience. These are great ways to learn skills that you may not get from the lab you volunteer in and you have to write. Being able to communicate is so important and these courses really drive it home. Also the classes are really small (8-15 people) so you get more attention. These classes are easier to get in if you are getting a BS. 

The major is becoming significantly more popular. One of the professors I was close to said they have a huge incoming class (400 maybe?) So they will be working on dealing with that in terms of class size/availability. It is already very difficult to get into neuro courses so it will be interesting to see how they approach the growing class size.

1. Focusing on social conformity. You are expected to conform to the fraternities social values or you won't be accepted. This often means pretending to be someone you are not, and 'bonding' with people you don't like. (Also, 95% of the people in your fraternity will be white, from identical socio-economic backgrounds, the same interests, the same level of social adaptiveness, etc. Lot's of people hate that, including me.)
2. ""Connections"" are the reason many people join fraternities. I think this is something many people naturally look down upon. Perhaps because society seems to more and more respect the actual value you can output rather than who you were friends with in college. (Hence, whiteboard questions and the decline of banking).
3. Sex. I will admit I see the attraction here, and many people are probably jealous, but many also view the copious amounts of sex as animalistic.
4. Parties on Thursdays. Parties can be fun, but not three times a week.
5. Pretentious money. Driving expensive cars their parents bought, working decent paying but value sucking jobs, and divorce.

(1) Get a backpack cover from REI for like $10 so at least your books won’t get wet (seriously, this has saved my butt). Obviously, you can’t use an umbrella on a bike (and rain jackets don’t help much at 15+mph in torrential downpours), so expect to get wet in if you rely on biking to get to farther classes on time.

(2)  If you aren’t very in-shape or have exercise-induced asthma, you may have an issue going up Dean Keaton, 21st, or other hilly roads. Looking at maps doesn’t tell you anything about the hilliness, so it wasn’t something I realized until it was a problem.

This is not even remotely True.  (Unless he was being specific and talking only about injuries at UT?  If so, I still doubt it, but I'd want to see his source.)

The statistics are not entirely clear, but [motorists are at fault at least as often as cyclists in the crashes between the two](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2011/05/20/136462246/when-bikes-and-cars-collide-whos-more-likely-to-be-at-fault), and ""it happens at an intersection where somebody ran a stop sign"" isn't even the [most common situation where a bicycle crashes](https://www.californiabicyclesafety.com/what-are-the-most-common-types-of-bicycle-accidents/).

That said, stopping at stop signs is still important.  Nobody reliably does it when there's no other traffic to yield to, cyclists or drivers, but it is indeed a common cause of crashes (for both cars and bicycles) when somebody screws up and there *was* other traffic to yield to.  And UTPD does enforce that law fairly well.

To be most competitive, students should have earned credit for calculus and should have complete or in progress a minimum of nine credit hours in first-year math and science courses for science majors. A grade of A or B in all math and science courses is also desirable.""

AET classes are cool, but AET 304 is def not what you are looking for because its way too basic. No offense but you will learn NOTHING from it.

If you want to learn some serious post-production techniques or create arts with Adobe CC or 3D softwares.... Idk about the AET side, but for RTF:  
&gt;**RTF 329C Digital Media Production (Web Based) with Ben Bays**: Adobe After Effects, Adobe Animation, Maya, Adobe Photoshop. Since it's a WB class, it's self-paced and free to explore. I would say start with this class if you are new to the field.

&gt;**RTF 344M Intro to VFX/Motion Graphics with Ben Bays**: Adobe After Effects (motion graphics), some basic Maya skills (mostly the basic workflow like how to render with Maya software or Arnold). Most importantly, I think you can get in as a non-major.

&gt;**RTF 344N Advanced VFX/Motion Graphics with Deepak Chetty**: it's in the title...advanced....and Mr. Chetty made a hella cool sci-fi short film. [Link to his thesis film. He did most of the VFX by himself](https://youtu.be/Widp-Nbki6k)  

And...it's really really easy to get As in Mr. Bays' classes.....

How else do you expect them to pay for the new construction?

&gt;	who drive up the price and lobby to further gentrify Austin.


https://www.dailytexanonline.com/2018/08/26/west-campus-growth-does-not-bring-lower-rent-prices

As this semi-deceptively titled article says, new construction has helped keep rents from rising even higher than they currently are. Obviously there are issues with intentional vacancies, which could probably be solved with a tax on unoccupied apartments, but overall the new construction has been beneficial to students in wampus. I wouldn’t be surprised if, in the next 1-2 years as an additional 1500 units under construction finish, rents or the rate of rent increase don’t drop. 

&gt;	Housing prices in Austin have been heavily driven up in recent years due to the influx of new residents from areas of higher costs of living.

I agree more people means more demand for housing. But how do you stop new people from moving in? And do you think having **less** housing supply will cause rent **decrease???** 

&gt;	gentrify Austin

In general, gentrification lowers rents city wide while sometimes raising rents in specific neighborhoods. Considering the other factors in west campus, we’d need a specific study to know how wampus has actually been impacted by the overall gentrification of Austin. In general its actually people fighting new development (especially multi-family zoning) and instituting rent control and other NIMBY polcies that cause rents to rise.

Edit: Also that Forbes article mostly talks about home ownership in North Austin and high rise Development in downtown. Not that wampus is an isolated market, but its population is mostly students and is probably less impacted by tech company migrants than the areas closer to the new Apple/Google campuses that the article talks about.",0.1191,0.5367,0.3441

(Each student gets a certain number of free tutoring (one-on-one) hours in certain subjects such as math &amp; science, etc., there is free drop-in tutoring, and you can consult with a Learning Specialist if you have specific general learning concerns.) If you need more help you can also hire a grad student for tutoring in math, physics, etc. 

4. This varies by department &amp; level. Intro math/science courses are about 100 - 120 students  or more per class, but upper division courses are often much smaller (20 - 40.) Larger classes often have smaller discussion sections that are led by grad students. Some large classes use undergraduates for learning assistance, too.

6. If you are interested in physics, well there aren't a lot of internships in that area, but there are REUs - Research Experiences for Undergraduates, which usually are held in the summer. You usually apply for these for the summers after your sophomore or junior years, and if you are accepted, you are often given a stipend to cover expenses. You go to another university and participate in a research projects with other students, grad students, and scientists. You do have to be a US citizen for this, since it's funded by the National Science Foundation

There are more internship opportunities for some majors - i.e., computer science, but if you search, you can find some for the other majors.

7. The Physics Department has some good opportunities for students to get involved in undergraduate research. It's a very hard major, but most of the students seem very enthusiastic.

1071,"Hi, glad you could join us! So with the Big Ticket, as a student you are supposed to be restricted to the student section. All Big Ticket seats there are on a first come, first serve basis, so if you want good seats come early right as the gates open and claim your spot. In terms of sitting with nonstudent friends and family, you might be able to sneak them into the student section. However, there is security checking for your student id before you enter the seating area and giving you a wristband to prevent that, so I have had some friends go sit with friends/families at their particular seat in the nonstudent sections, but in popular games if the adjacent seats are taken that might not work. But to sit with your friends and family guaranteed, you might have to purchase a separate ticket, but that's up to you. IMO the Big Ticket is a steal, and is worth it to take advantage of as you get all football home games for a pretty good price compared to the nonstudent tickets in which sitting up close can cost a lot more money, while the Big Ticket can get you close up for a fraction of the cost (you also get access to other sports too!).

1085,"Both exams and projects are straight forward. We had a few homework assignments that take a couple hours (I struggled more than most people) and the biggest thing I learned from the exams is be able to write out the code by hand (not referring to other codes for syntax - that’s a huge one). They might do some very small tricks in an exam but if you are confident in your logic and maybe a random rule or two that they’ll repeat, you’ll be fine. 

There’s one big project for each language but they offer lots of help if you need it. The profs were VERY easy to talk to and approachable cuz they wanted you to learn, not just make a grade. Grading was straight forward. Not nazi, but also not handing out lots of points for free. 

If you have previous coding, you’re fine. You have the basic logic part figured out so it’ll just be syntax really what you’ll need to learn and it’s very straightforward for each of the languages so expect it to be a lighter workload. They start as if you’ve never even used a command line and it’s really hands on. The classes are a lot of mini challenges that make you think but push you towards the end goal. They provided a book but I found the slides to be much more useful. 

FORTRAN....tbh I can’t remember how far we got. I know I’m C++ it was object oriented programming (OOP) that we dipped our toes into (learned how to write functions and classes, etc) so I think for FORTRAN it was the similar level.

So normally finance students are recruiting for their junior year summer internships the fall before. At most, they have taken Fin 357 (Intro Finance) and are taking a few finance courses at the time. If you are to move your grad year up, you would have taken the same finance courses but likely would not have as strong of work experience (1 summer vs 2 summers) and would have longer class hours per semester which would create a higher risk for your GPA. Not to say it can’t be done, but it ultimately makes your job prospects more difficult. I’ve seen quite a few people graduate a semester early which keeps the internship opportunities and allows you to save on 1 semester of college. I think if it were a different major and you were looking to grad school, the answer would be different.

I got a 5 on the AB section of calc, and a 3 on the BC section. Confident in how I felt about cal ""1"", I took 408D.

Only I didn't realize how I wasn't ready for college and 8ams, with increased social activity, later nights, etc. My problem was predominantly sleep based, as I did well enough in my 11 hrs, but I ended up having to take 408D again, and build up my GPA through the rest of my four years. It's really all about what you think and commit yourself to doing.

I understand 408D may get you ""one semester ahead"" in some cases, but I advise against it unless you know you're going to be dedicated to your studies. Also 408C is a free pass if you're confident with it, or a nice free GPA boost if you're unsure with how you're gonna do",0.1251,0.4829,0.392

Most UT premeds elects to take N and S because the extra work required by C and D isn’t worth it, with an even bigger portion electing to only take M408N, or skip calculus entirely and take stats. 

I do have a question though, can you wait on taking calculus? You can take it later when you’re a junior or senior and have a better chance at getting a better teacher!

He does let you bring print-outs of the readings to exams which makes things easier, but you’re not going to be able to read the whole thing during your exams. It was really helpful for me to just put a sentence in the margin every few lines explaining what each section of the text was about. He also provides online photocopies, so they’re pretty easy to print off and annotate (I did this instead of a notebook)

He explains what he wants you to get out of the text during class, so you don’t have to think too hard about the “message” or themes that the reading is supposed to convey as long as you pay attention. He also doesn’t put much on his lecture slides so it’s important to attend lecture and listen.

Grading depends on your TA, mine was super relaxed so I did very well with little effort (think an A for an essay written in 15 minutes). The final exam my year also had an optional third essay worth an extra 50%, so I actually got a 110% on my final. If you’ve taken any advanced English classes in high school or college already, it should be easier, even if you didn’t like them.

2152,"Speaking as someone who came in the first year the major came into being, the overall state of AET is kinda weird. Comparing the major from how it was my freshman year to now, there's been a lot of improvement. The amount of available coursework has expanded dramatically (and is continuing to do so), we have our own school within the College of Fine Arts now, and there's been a lot of refinement of how each track should be treated. The major has a lot of potential to be good and the faculty have shown that, at least on some level, they're capable of making improvements and bettering the program as a whole.  
That all being said, some aspects of it are still a mess. We have very few (if any) tenured professors teaching in the program. I don't necessarily think that's a big negative, as I've had a lot of good experiences with AET coursework, but it is worth noting all the same.    
You mentioned wanting to go down the digital visualization track, which might be the worst track in the major right now. I've taken a lot of classes with the professor who heads that branch, and most of them have been extremely poorly run. Granted, a lot of them were running for the first time when I took them, but there was a lot of impromptu changes to the syllabus, axing projects halfway through the semester, and incredibly useless lectures that consisted of just scrolling through a random blogpost that he found. He could be turning it around and refining the classes, but he's also constantly teaching 2-3 new classes a semester, which makes me think that there'll be a lot of repeat of what I dealt with. For the record, he's a really nice and approachable guy and he obviously cares a lot about seeing his students succeed, and he's always willing to work with you one-on-one if you need it, which is something he's actually pretty good at doing.  
Overall, I'd say that I'm happy with the major, but I've also got three years invested in it now and am doing the game dev track instead of digital visualization, so take that as you will.

The class was pretty straight forward/easy. He gives you the test questions the class before the test. The few tests (he calls them quizzes) are usually over the readings/movies he gives but they're mostly big-picture essay format questions over the material. He'll give you some material to read before each class day. I mostly skimmed through them and made sure I got the big picture and then looked more into detail once I found out which ones were involved in the test questions. An A is a 95 and above but he gives a 5 point extra credit group assignment so just make sure you find a group for it. The primary assignment in his class is a research essay out of a selection of possible topics/your own chosen topic (as long as it pertains to the class).  

Attendance is graded but isn't taken from the get-go (it only started being graded after the first quiz halfway through the semester), so don't think that you can skip every class.

1. It can be either, depending on what classes you pick. There's a breadth requirement (you have to take at least one class in each of systems/applications/theory), but otherwise you fill out the rest of your classes with whatever you want.

2. In general grad class manner, it's usually harder but the grading is easier. If you've taken honors undergrad classes they're around that difficulty (but again, depends on the specific class)

3. Depends wholly on the class and your interests. In general I would say no, it's just fun to learn cool stuff that you wouldn't have an opportunity to learn otherwise. Not much content to cover in a grad class for building standard web-apps in the industry.

An additional thing: The online MS program is new, and I've heard from people that it's going to take a couple semesters/years to stabilize and get all the wrinkles ironed out, so I would recommend against doing it (unless you like to be the class the profs run teaching experiments on)

The only situations in which taking the class might make sense are if 1) there are later classes for which it is a prerequisite, and you don't feel comfortable jumping straight in, or, 2) your credit score is just barely above the threshold, and you think that you can get an A in the class.

2370,"So, with how the major is set up, you don't ever formally pick a track to pursue. Anybody can take any of the classes offered by the major, assuming you have the pre-reqs for for it. Generally, how it works is that you take broad classes covering most of what the major has to offer for lower division, then you'll fill out your upper division hours with coursework in the track you're interested in (music/sound, digitial visualization, game dev, PLAY). 
That said, there's nothing stopping you from spreading out your coursework across the divisions (some overlap is encouraged, even). The tracks aren't a rigid thing, they're just what we use to organize the courses into more specific fields.  
As for the first question, I guess I kinda started doing both game design and digital visualization? Again, because you never actually declare a track, it's hard to say, but I've been taking both game dev courses and animation/digital imaging courses all the way through.

2406,"Feynman Notes.  Saved my career.

Buy a worthy notebook, like the National brand Computation Notebook.  None of the cheap loose bound notebooks at walmart.  Write everything in pen.

In lecture, take careful notes especially of example problems, because sometimes youll never see them again.  

On weekends, learn from the book or other material about the concepts.  Take notes as if lecturing to self.  Its like writing your own textbook, but in your own language that is simple to you. Apply to example problems.  

Periodically, consolidate all notes and condense.  

In EE, most exams allow one sheet of notes.  You know when youve studied well when making your sheet if its mostly copy and paste from consolidated notes and the sheet isnt fully filled.

Went from a ECE semester of three C's and a D, to all A's nbetween fresh and sophomore yr.  My study habits went fron leisurely distractions in PCL to full time &gt;8 hr days in the library on the weekends.  Weekdays were strictly reserved for actually doing HW using the consolidated notes.  Minimal time was spent guessing and figuring out the homework.",0.3408,0.532,0.1272

I went on academic probation and turned my life around and went crazy hard in the books next semester and went to tutoring even when I didn’t need to. At the time, i thought it was over for me. I didn’t know what i wanted to pursue, and i thought grad school was completely out of the question. I worked my ass off and took summer classes and completely changed my way of life and graduated with a 3.66. After that semester i think i only made 2 B+ but the rest were A”s. I joined a shitton of clubs for social reasons and for community service. I am now attending a decently ranked law school in Texas. This was not meant to brag in any way but to tell you that it’s possible.  I had the hardest time believing i would have any sort of future after i messed up so bad. I was extremely ashamed and depressed, and it was a really slow process. If you want it bad enough and you put in the hours you can totally save it. It’s possible.

i guess my follow up question would be, how has your experience been finding experience and/or work in the field, given that you're three years in? do you feel like the program does a good job at pushing you in the right direction when it comes to finding the proper networks, people, etc? or have you found that a lot of this communication rests in your own networking with the people around you? 

that, and if the digital visualization track seems to be worse off at the moment, would you probably recommend maybe just getting a certificate instead? or have you found that the complete immersion in the major / taking all the courses you have has benefit you more?  as in, do you feel the skills you've learned in game dev were easier to acquire in the major or is it something that anyone can learn on their own should they put in their own time? you totally don't have to answer that if you don't wanna, i know i'm asking questions that i should probably reserve for the advisor lol

2606,"I’ve heard vishik’s tests are similar to the hw but he doesn’t give much partial credit at all. You need about 90% average to get an A(unless he’s changed it), which means you pretty much have to be perfect to get an A. Some people do it but most people are just too scared; most people will tell you there are more manageable options. I had blazek, who made the tests pretty much exactly the same as homework/class problems(incentive to come to class) so they were pretty straightforward and he is pretty good with partial credit. He writes his own hw, btw, and doesn’t push you to read the book much bc it’s terrible. Blazek is the most popular bc he’s hilarious. Anyway, all in all, if the lecturing means nothing, vishik could be fine if you’re accurate.

Alex is probably the most popular math professor here bc he’s super committed to his students and teaches very clearly and there’s prolly no chance of getting that section now. His class isn’t supposed to be that difficult but he does expect you to work a little- last time I heard, hw was worth 40% of the grade(20% hw, 20% quiz which was a hw question)

Tschanka(wrong spelling) may open up. It’s a mixed bag depending on if you like his style. Tests are MC tho but I don’t think there’s any partial credit if you miss it and he doesn’t give full credit for guessing it. Some people like it bc he gives decent notes and old tests but if you don’t know exactly what’s happening the tests can be tricky. If attendance means nothing to you, he’s prolly the wrong choice bc he adds points to your course grade based on attendance.

We were never asked to check everyone's tickets when they entered (unless if someone asked us to help them find their seats), so you may be able to get away with it if you don't whip out your ticket and show the usher and just walk past them. That being said, if you sit down in someone else's seats that they paid for, they can have you removed, so you're taking a risk by sitting in any assigned seat that isn't yours. We had to remove a lot of people for this reason, so I guess a lot of people do this. But, from my experience working there, tickets aren't checked at each section.

As for the student section, I'm surprised you were able to sneak in. I was under the impression that you had to scan your UT ID when you entered, making it much more difficult to get in. I was also told that there was increased supervision at the entrances making it more difficult to sneak past.

* By slipping past one of the people that checked your ticket at the entrances.
* By editing the PDF of the ticket to say student section even though the actual ticket isn't for the student section (this worked because the ushers didn't scan your ticket, they just looked at it to confirm it said student section on it).
* By purchasing someone's big ticket for said game if they were selling it.

Now, I believe that you have to scan your student ID to enter the student section, eliminating the second and third option, as tickets for home games (through the big ticket) used to be PDF files sent to your email, but now I think they are tied to your UT ID.

The first option is also unlikely to work because the entrances now are smaller and more closely watched.

All of the these changes they made recently are to prevent people who didn't have the big ticket or people who didn't have student section access from easily getting in.

You can reference those two lists to figure out what counts for what.  Keep in mind the flag ""gotcha"" which is that in order to earn a flag, you must take the class at UT. You can't transfer in a flag or get one from AP credit.

I think the only two flags that engineering students won't earn via the standard engineering classes are CD and GC.

If you pick an engineering major and decide you want a different one, you can't change until after the first semester (read: must take classes for a major your don't want) and it is very hard to do (more or less have to get a 4.0 to guarantee you get the change of major)",0.0593,0.484,0.4567

Look at what the work of professors in the department focuses on, is there more than one faculty member doing something you're interested in, if you met with them did you get along etc. Different schools will lead in different subfields even if their overall reputation is very different. 

Keep in mind it's also a different type of experience than undergrad. You probably wont be taking classes (except those you want to audit) after the first 2 years so the curriculum itself even matters a lot less than you'd think.

Berkeley does have a slightly better overall reputation, but it might be better to do grad school somewhere different than your undergrad to expand your network

Jaehyun (BTS V is my ult. male bias so it was pretty easy for me to like him for the similar reasons that I like V and what V is well known for tbh), Hwasa (""TWIT"" should be a SOTY contender pls and QUEEN!), Wheein (my most favorite female voice of KPOP and my Wheepup :D) , E:U, Mia, Leedo, and Keonhee are my biases of these respective groups but I like the other members as well!

V's ""Singularity"" is such a blessing of 2018 and I really love his self-composed solo work (been playing ""Winter Bear"" on hour loop and ""Scenery"" is one of the best songs that I've ever listened in my life lol) as well (when he actually gets to sing in his natural deep lyric baritone voice, he really shines and I love it :') - my most favorite voice in BTS and one of my most favorites in KPOP and in general and with more training, he would be great pls make it happen...) and I love Suga's produced songs as well (""Let Me Know"" is one of the best BTS songs objectively, let's say that lol). MAMAMOO is my ult. group (stream ""Gleam"" :D) and I really love their music as a jazz and R&amp;B fan and love the multi-talented vocal powerhouse queens with crackhead personalities and amazing group bond with the other groups more recent as well.

I know around ~10 people who went to UTD and all of them struggled to find internships and full time jobs from actual tech and non tech companies (they ended up relying on conferences or continuously just grinding more). With UT it’s much more easier to get interviews and you get much more networking and much more recruiters actively reach out to orgs and in general (Friends of CS has a plethora of good companies that you can search on the CS department website). 

Biased here but I’d also say the education at UT is immensely more rigorous and challenging as well — from what I’ve heard at UTD it seems like a smaller step up from high school.

Personally I wasn’t really looking for a social org and hanging out in their office was enough for me (because I was looking for more personal relationships) so I guess it depends on what you’re looking for. 

There are several other orgs as well - WICS (women in CS), HACS (Hispanics in CS), ABCS (African Americans in CS), ISSS (Information Systems and Security Society — I was an officer for this org and if you’re interested in security it’s a huge recommendation because they’ve improved quite a lot the past few years with challenging CTFs!!), MAD (Mobile app development, EGADS (gaming), Convergent (business and CS collaboration), and Freetail (these people coordinate to organize Hackathons including our best and biggest HackTX). I think just last semester they added a LGBTQ+ club? Don’t remember what it was called or what they do because it wasn’t advertised well and weren’t anywhere to be found much in the CS building?


WICS, HACS, ABCS are all social orgs and even if you aren’t a woman, Hispanic, African American doesn’t matter you can still hang with them and make great friends (Really recommend because almost all of them are my closest friends). If you can’t attend you can also pop in the Diversity office on the third floor lab and say hello. 
All of the other orgs are also located on the third floor lab and if you want to ask for more information you can go as well! The other orgs are more preference based but I’d say just as useful depending on your skill level/interests",0.8289,0.1632,0.0079

1)  Name’s Angelina
2) Math - Actuarial Science ‘23
3) Female/Straight
4) Dallas Area
5) Littlefield

6) Not going to lie, relatively hard question for me. I like trying out new activities and am always down to learn something unique. Besides that, I do indulge in Kpop quite a bit.

7) Not exactly favorites, but if I ever feel like there’s enough time, My Hero Academia, the second season of One Punch Man, &amp; Hotel Del Luna are shows I would love to check out.

8) Kpop in general is what I enjoy listening to! Red Velvet, Seventeen, BTS, Mamamoo, Twice, Sunmi, Astro...there are so many singers who have released amazing tunes. 

9) I go through a lot of phases when it comes to YouTube, although I consistently watch DanPlan since I’m a fan of hypothetical situations (&amp; also the group’s entertaining dynamic).

10) Not exactly a sporty person, though I do enjoy hiking!

11) I really want to join some volunteering organizations! Definitely considering “Texas Kids Read,” and am hoping there’s an organization that helps out the homeless too. 

12) Nothing to plug unfortunately.

13) Even though I’m fairly introverted in that socializing can tire me out, I actually really like being around people and would never turn down a friendly conversation. It’s always so interesting for me to hear different people’s perspectives on various topics.  
(Also, no doubt a completely random fact, but I have a weakness for Thai Tea and will always order it if found on a menu)

I hope everyone has an excellent year at UT. Best of wishes to 2019-2020 &amp; beyond!",0.9526,0.043,0.0043

Again, I really love to learn and attain knowledge (Philomath) about pretty much anything, especially CS and math

Also, for the past two years, I’ve had major struggles with low self-confidence, anxiety (especially during exams/tests), self-doubt, and insecurity due to Impostor Syndrome, especially with matters concerning my primary major (Computer Science) and it really got pretty bad to the point it was affecting my performance in my CS classes (my CS classes were the worst-performing classes ironically for the past two semesters), the way I perceived myself and other people, how I contribute to group projects in my classes (I ducked myself out too often because I thought that people knew more than I did), and even my friendships and relationships with other people. Specifically, I thought that 90% of the people in my major were a lot smarter and better in what I was doing than me and even doubted many times whether I was in the right major or not. The problem was that I often don’t know what I feel and suppress feelings too often (preference of thinking over feeling) until the worst moments possible so these insecurities got worse over time until this April or May when I reached a new low point. This summer, though I got several internship offers, I decided to relax and pick up new hobbies or hobbies I haven’t touched in a long time (like reading!) and a job at JJ Pickle where I got to learn a lot and spend time with people who truly cared about me and I truly care about back and learned how to believe and trust myself more and gain back the confidence I once lost. Sure, the future path will not be easy and there will be times when I will be tempted to go back where I was months ago, but with life experience, the path will be easier (though not sure by how much) than months ago. There’s a lot more to the story, but I just want to keep it short for personal reasons and I really want to meet and talk with people who faced similar struggles whether same major or not, because it doesn’t take one person to fight a battle, but multiple people as well. :)",0.6784,0.3163,0.0053

""DHFS removed trays from its dining halls in 2008, almost halving their excess food waste, according to Mangrum. Kinsolving and J2 disposed of a estimated 111.94 tons of excess food waste in fall 2008. After banning trays, the same facilities disposed of 58.44 tons of food waste in fall 2009. In fall 2014, Kinsolving and J2 produced an estimated 43.59 tons of excess food waste.""

(I don't know if they've been re-introduced and taken away since then - sounds like from another comment here.)

They also take a lot of resources to clean. 

The student spearheading this initiative was a UT math major who went to Cockrell's graduate Operational Research and Industrial Engineering program.

But yeah, it's a pain to not have them, especially if you are like me and a bit uncoordinated.

3312,"1) Definitely MATLAB and C++, probably some others thrown in there depending on which classes/clubs you join

2) No idea, but it's an upper-division class so now may a bit early to stress over it

3) Of course, you get get involved in pretty much every club at UT as a freshman. In fact, there are typically a couple of recruitment sessions geared specifically towards freshman at the start of the semester. As for research, you probably won't find a spot in an Aerospace/Engineering lab, but depending on your coding abilities and other skills you may be able to find something else. Just cold-email different professors whose research interests you and hope for the best, it is not unheard of for freshman to get research opportunities.

4) You can, but it really depends on who you research with. Most research tends to be unpaid.

5) You get to do a lot of cool shit, but you also spend a lot of time stressing and studying.

6) Not very doable unless you're an exceptionally brilliant learner. Aerospace and CS are probably the two most difficult majors out there, and most people struggle completing just one of those degrees, and you'd add an extra year or two to graduation. Plus, if you're not already a CS major it might be next to impossible to transfer in. Rather, you might want to take a Computational Engineering minor, as it will teach a lot of coding and align itself with what you're doing in your Aerospace classes.",0.1792,0.4918,0.329

3314,"In school I was a person who talked frequently in class. It began mostly in reaction to anxiety about getting participation points in discussion-based classes. Later it just became a habit as I realized I understood the material better when I was active in class discussions. Even though I never felt particularly confident or competent or eloquent (though I do think my comments got more insightful as I participated more). Sometimes I would even preface comments by saying things like ""I am still in the process of solidifying my thoughts on this, but it seems that...."" Somehow foregrounding my uncertainty made me feel less stressed about saying the exact right, perfect thing.   


I was surprised, later in college, when I had conversations with people I had been in classes with, and they expressed that they and others perceived me as brave and competent based on my frequently talking in class. Often I figured that quieter people had it more figured out and that was why they didn't need to speak up to ask for clarifications, etc.

I guess my point is that even the people who seem like they have it so together probably don't. Everyone is probably a bit self-conscious and they are likely too distracted by that to judge your comments--even if you feel like you are fumbling, as I often did. Even if your comments aren't that eloquent or genius, that can actually be a relief to your classmates as it takes off some of the pressure to perform smartness in the class. Once you get rid of the performance pressure, you can just use talking for what it should be: a tool to help you learn and share your thoughts with others. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also keep in mind that the way discussion classes work is by everyone sharing their own points of view. No perspective is more or less valuable than others, and you are really adding value to the class by sharing your reactions--it may not seem like it to you, but it's also True that thoughts rarely seem revelatory to the person who thinks them. An idea or reaction or question that seems painfully obvious or half-baked to you could be a perspective others would never consider if you did not voice it! 

&amp;#x200B;

In summary... Don't overthink it too much, just be genuine and share how you are reacting to the class material. You'll ease in eventually. Others feel the way you do, even if it doesn't seem like it. :)",0.257,0.5641,0.1789

2) Journalism, 2023

3) female, pan (?, mainly still figuring things out)

4) Houston, TX (In the Pasadena area for y’all who are from Houston as well)

5) Jester West

6) Watching kdramas, anime, some movies and shows when I’m in the mood. I also love writing and drawing (painting is nice too, but it’s very stressful). 

7) I love the kdramas Strong Girl Do Bong Soon and Weightlifting Fairy. My favorite anime has been My Hero Academia (even though I haven’t kept up like i should, oops). Favorite movies are Bohemian Rhapsody, Your Name, and Crazy Rich Asians. I also love the MCU movies (which I’m also behind on). I’ve also weirdly gotten into Minecraft lately so dm me to add me to your world ✊😤.

8) I really like kpop like BTS, NCT, Twice, CL, SVT, Stray Kids, GOT7, Taemin, Day6, The Rose, and Dean (he is more krnb but y’all know if you know). I also am a huge fan of Lizzo, Megan thee Stallion, H.E.R, Daniel Caesar, Catfish and the Bottlemen, Lewis Capaldi, Billie Eilish, Panic! at the Disco, All Time Low, girl in red, Conan Gray, The Neighbourhood, Paramore, and many more but I already wrote a lot.

9) I watch a lot of Shane Dawson, Jenna Marbles, Smosh, Bon Appetit, Edward Avila, The Try Guys, Daniel Howell, AmazingPhil, Jubilee, and again some others but my list is getting long.

10) I really like watching football, basketball, volleyball, and soccer. Even if I’m not 100% sure what is entirely going on. But, I don’t really play any sports.

11) I’m interested in joining Texas Fuego, The Daily Texan, Comm Council (in Moody), Texas Hellraisers, and maybe Texas Quidditch (but only the non-traveling group).

12) My twitter is @tropicanalucy (I’m kind of a big kpop fan but i do keep it //somewhat// under control), my instagram is also @tropicanalucy, and my snapchat is lucy_lopez. :)

13) I’m a Latinx, First-Gen college student, so I would really appreciate having some friends that are down to do anything, since college is what we make of it!! So, feel free to hit me up wether it be to go to a party, a school event, or even to go grab a bite to eat! I’m pretty shy irl, so I hope that I can make some friends through this thread!

The correct spelling is ""always."" The man mumbles incoherent nonsense into a whiteboard for an hour then leaves. The textbook is a very good resource. Resist the urge to Chegg the homeworks because they're the only way you will learn, and often the answers are wrong anyway.

Avoid any and all honors sections of math. I took M 408D honors, and while the professor I had was amazing, he made us put so much more work into the class than the normal, non-honors kids. Don't do it to yourself.

Connolly for COE 301. I actually recomend him as a professor but he tends to have ridiculously high cutoffs for As (95-97 range) but also has relatively easier tests and is one of the nicest teachers here. If you tend to make stupid addition errors and the like, it can be frustrating to miss that 95 on a test because you forgot to carry the two. On the other hand, Connolly is very generous with partial credit and COE 301 is the easiest engineering class you will ever take, but there is not a lot of room for error.

Tsischanka for M 427J. His tests consist of 6-7 MC questions, and you have to show work and get the problem correct to get full credit for the question. If you miss the question there is no partial credit.

3784,"Hi, current RTF sophomore here.

I took RTF 308, RTF 317, RTF 318, RTF 329C,RTF 344M, taking RTF 307, RTF 345C, RTF 331P, and RTF 344N. As you can see I'm more post-production.

1. **What are your thoughts on the program holistically?** Overall a solid program, would be better if there weren't RTF 307 and the 3 mandatory media studies classes. UTRTF is certainly good enough for a student to practice and establish connections. Imo, film schools are about having access to fancy cinema cameras and getting to know the people in it—not learning how to use a camera or write a script.
2. **How many internships and job opportunities were presented to you?** I will not pursue a career in filmmaking (at least for now), so Idk how to answer that. But according to Micah's stories, the best way to find your place in the industry is networking with literally anyone u meet in school/film festival/daily life.
3. **I don’t necessarily want to go into film writing but rather film production, is this the right degree?** It absolutely is the right degree. [The flowchart of production classes](https://utexas.app.box.com/s/js0satfi9iozlmer132moavmiv7at4eg). I would say the main focus of UTRTF is more production instead of pre-production/post-production.
4. **Did you find this to be a rewarding experience? Or were you more stressed about your classes?** Yes, it is a rewarding experience. It is relatively easy to get As in UTRTF, so RTF classes won't give me any stress. Plus, RTF308 *with Fuller-Seely*, and RTF318 *with Micah Barber* are the most satisfying classes I took at UTRTF so far. Their classes are just amazing.
5. **What sparked your interest in RTF?** RTF308 *with Fuller-Seely*, and RTF318 *with Micah Barber.* The former got me interested in the history of the film industry, the latter got me interested in the current film industry. RTF329C and RTF344M *with Ben Bays*, I was 🤯🤯🤯 when I learned the fact that UT owns the second-biggest green screen studio among all the U.S. universities (even bigger than NYU's).",0.7497,0.2199,0.0304

3798,Hey thanks! This is some of the best advice I’ve gotten from a grad. That’s really good to hear you say that UT was worth because the primary thing that has stopped me from going for RTF before is that I have felt that it is not worth it. I’ve felt that it’s a field that you don’t necessarily need a degree for so I’m happy to hear that the majority of your connections were built through UT.,0.954,0.0361,0.0099

3802,"Alumn here:

Program has always offered a way for student to take the degree into a more technical path as well as creative. I went through school with a focus on cinematography and ultimately geared myself as a 1st AC. 90% of my current work consist of people I went to school with, or met because of UT, including Rooster Teeth, working on 2 commercials with MM, and meeting ASC cinematographers and pulling focus on movies for them. 

Most classes in upper division RTF are actually production classes such as sound mixing, cinematography, lighting, VFX, or producing (to name a few). There are also directing classes, or writing classes in many different flavors (features, specs, pilots, series, etc) if that is a thing you want to really focus on. 

I would say that going to UT and working on every set I could get onto was what made college worth it for me. I always had access to top of the line equipment and some grad students are actually union filmmakers who have taken time to come back to school and learn more things/ tell their own stories again. I never really cared about the other classes, mostly just took them without really trying just to check the box for graduation.

I ask about her personal career as well as why she switched from X to Y and if she liked it. She said she trained new grads for a program they have so i asked what kind of challenges that a new grad with little experience face, or what advice/ expectation she has for them coming in with little experience . She added me on LinkedIn afterward. Or i talked to someone from Oracle and found out he’s also from COLA with a business minor so i asked about how useful the minor is, if he was worried about jobs and how he got a full time job post grad successfully, what his job entailed and did he feel like his COLA major prepared him for it. For some companies that im not familiar with, i also asked more about what they do with my little knowledge like i know you do X, i took a Finance class and we had a lesson on it but i’d like to know more, what kind of clients do u serve? Wha’d the difference between X fund and Y fund? Target has been vocal about leaving less carbon footprints, diversity, volunteering etc so that’ll also be a good talking point compare to the usual questions. Or just anything interesting from their website to you. I volunteer for a non profit that have donors who are companies. I’d bring that up as well to get the conversation going. But sometimes you can ask the right question but to the wrong people. Not all employers i met are helpful and enthusiastic. I tried to make connection but they answered very curtly that allow you nothing to grab onto to continue the conversation so dont feel bad if that happens

3850,"When you feel good about yourself height matters a lot less. I'm usually not the tallest guy in the room but I have a great build and a charismatic personality. It's those two things that help me feel better about my height and improve my self-esteem. 

To make you feel a bit better, I'm five foot seven and not white. I'm not gonna leave you on that note though lol. Feeling good about yourself takes a minute to get to but in terms of solutions I suggest you:

- Buy shoes with a good amount of cushion/heel. I recommend New Balance or some dress boots.
- Start working out to gain muscle mass. The more muscular you are at our height the more attractive you are (don't overdo it though). 
- Start looking into self-improvement. I'm not talking books, I'm talking see what kind of person you want to be and think of actionable steps to get you there. I want to have better mental health -&gt; start seeing a psychologist (Ph.D. preferably).
- Start looking for dates. Someone is going to think you're attractive. I don't care how fucked up looking you think you are, I promise there is someone out there that probably wants to bang you. It's a huge confidence booster and basically tells you, ""Hey! I can actually attract the opposite sex!"" However, sometimes it takes a lot of swings before you actually hit. 

Do you know why scrawny frat guys get laid? It's not because they're particularly physically attractive, it's because they literally believe in themselves because no one has told them that they couldn't hook up with this girl, or make the basketball team- a lot was kind of handed to them but that's a different post. Also, I'm not trashing all frat guys lol, I'm one myself but it's definitely a common paradigm of a high-tier frat guy. Additionally, their personality attracts the opposite sex in the communities they're after (sororities). Attraction is personality-based and situational, your appearance is only one component that can be heavily outweighed by a single conversation. No one wants to date a fucking moron. They might fuck them, sure, but nothing will come of it and the well-rounded guy that's shorter than usual with a nice build and charismatic personality will get the girl.

Also, lots of people in CNS are doing all of this stuff all the time, they’re members of orgs that promote shadowing/research etc. So it’s easy to connect with people who are doing it and get the DL. That’s worth a lot.
2) Yes, but they are often taught by some of the best professors in CNS. So it’s worth it. 
3) There is only one application, and they’ll often put you in a different program than the one you applied for if your experience/resume lends itself to it (pretty sure this isn’t True if you’re applying after matriculating at UT). Acceptance for each program depends on your background—Dean’s students have to show aptitude for research, HSS for pre-Med biosciencey stuff, Polymaths for anything as long as it includes science and relatively broad. Dean’s is the oldest and is very well established socially (and otherwise), but the other two are better for many people.

 A few notes:

* Texas Athletics emailed students reminding them of the 2019 season student section locations along with other helpful game day information. They plan to send students another email prior to game day.
* The student sections for the Big Ticket for the 2019 season are and have been Sections 19-23, 25 and 29-32.  
* The Big Ticket gives students general admission to UT sports events on a first come, first served basis. It does not guarantee a student a ticket to any sporting event. 
* Texas Athletics does not oversell the student section. They know exactly how many seats are available and with each student swipe, the inventory is reduced. Students want to be in certain sections and when the section's capacity is met, they have to look to another student section for their seating. If they see two spots in a section and have four in their group, they can either split up their group or go to another section to find if the number of seats they want together are available. 
* Texas Athletics is working on stadium staff communications about coming and going from student sections. The safety and well-being of the fans is their priority.
* Wristbands were used last season and are not applicable this season.
* The stadium construction was announced this spring as a two year project.

We compete at all levels, from Collegiate (we're two-time Novice and Overall Collegiate National Champions, beating out schools like MIT, Berkeley, Stanford, etc) to international (recently had two members represent the US at the  [World Cup Team Championships](https://www.facebook.com/pg/TexasTaekwondo/posts/) and we compete almost monthly at various tournaments/scrimmages from around the state to around the world. We actually just hosted National Collegiates last year, with over 500 athletes from I believe over 50 colleges. We're even offering a $10,000 pool of competition stipends to any high-performance team athletes (black belts competing internationally), and we subsidize club trips to places like MIT to compete in their Taekwondo league.

Even if you're not looking to compete, you'll still get flexibility, mobility, and cardio out of the workouts. We do a special fitness camp class twice a week to focus more on those aspects as they apply to Taekwondo (stuff like leg control drills, bodyweight training, hill sprints, short and long runs) in case you're just looking for an extra workout outside of Taekwondo class. And poomsae (forms) class, three times a week, trains the more traditional side of Taekwondo, which emphasizes control, focus, and flexibility.

And while we definitely believe in having a strong community, like going out to eat after practice, booking study rooms throughout the year and finals week, lots of socials, etc - we're all here to better ourselves and if we want, to test that through competition. I know it sounds cliche, but being a part of this community really helped shape who I am as a person, so I'm naturally passionate about evangelizing for it, in case you were wondering ;)

Hope that helps! Feel free to ask me any more questions you've got about the club! We've got [Open House practices](https://www.facebook.com/events/429156631022323) coming up tonight (Sept 5th) and next week (Sept 10th) where you can get a full info presentation, and you're welcome to stop by any of our other practices afterwards!",0.6521,0.3394,0.0085

This may seem dramatic, but I spent extensive time researching and studying House Bill 588—and this was the narrative I heard all too often. 

The percent rule empowers students, like this. It gives them an opportunity to immerse themselves in the most life-changing gift: education. Education that can change their future, their entire life. 

Students who don’t support this rule often get rejected from UT; however, most of those students can afford to go a different (and equally good) university. For students with nothing, the percent rule can be everything. 

I think UT needs to put more educational development programs for students to succeed (as some don’t come into the university with the readiness to deal with the college rigor), but as a great public institution in Texas it is UT’s responsibility to empower the future of TX—these students.

I was lucky to get in despite being in the top 19% because my GPA was about 3.75 and I had good test scores, but getting into UT was cause for stress for many of the people at my school for most our high school careers. There may be advantages to going to academically challenging high schools, but it's a cause of worry for so many people because despite performing exceptionally, they still have to compete for the very small percent of seats that are reserved for in-state non-auto admits just because their high school was super competitive or whatever.

Compared to Ivy league schools, UT wanted those students to stay within Texas and the UT system to return and conduct research to be competitive/competition to highly accredited Ivy league schools. This used to be the case, but as the student body got so massive, the model just wasn't sustainable anymore and talent from outside of the UT system was having to compete with automatic admission hurting the overall number of potential graduate/research career students.

Essentially, turning the number down to 6% allows more breathing room for UT to 1) push more funding to their current research programs and 2) selectively groom students to want to be in a prestigious research focused school. It makes sense numbers wise as globalization and ease of relocating pushes competition among schools higher and students start moving away from academic ""incest"".

I will say it's difficult to assimilate into a friend group, so get in one early, else you'll be a loner. Once people have their groups, they aren't great at letting others in. 
One thing you will get used to is the constant entitlement attitude. Many orgs and people you'll  meet have a heavy theme of believing they're better than everyone else, don't get sucked in. Stay humble.
Lastly, depending on if you have dark humor, you have to be extremely sensitive with what you say. UT austin caters to all which is great but light offensive jokes don't play.

4798,"Thanks. I’ve been working on this stuff for awhile, so I’ve got a little knowledge accumulated.

From what I understand, you need to make sure to express that you are interested in working with specific faculty members (1-3 name drops is good) at whatever institution you’re applying.
Try communicate what exactly appeals to you about their research. You don’t need to be an “expert” on it (at least, until you’re invited for an interview), nor do you need to talk at great length as to why you’re interested in working with them (unless there is a very specific reason you’re interested in a particular faculty member).

Really, all you need to convey is how this faculty members interests align with your own. For me, I’m really interested in multicultural psychology, so I’m looking to work with people who have working with people of diverse identities (ethnic, sexual, and gender) or whose work would be interested if applied in a multicultural sort of way (which could be really anything, but for me a lot have been related to studies of trauma or sexual violence).  
The best thing I can suggest is try to write as specifically as you can when conveying why you’d like to research with this person while still leaving a little breathing room so you don’t get “trapped” by whatever you wrote in your personal statement (Unless you really know you want to study neurochemical reactions to a specific phenomenon, for example, I wouldn’t be super specific about this interest in your essays). 

I’ve found myself using something like this format: “I have found Dr. X’s work on _______ to be insightful, and feel that that this research focus aligns closely with my interests.”
Then, if you already have an idea of what you would like to research with this person (don’t be afraid if you don’t), you could mention it after this.

In short, try to write these couple of sentences as if they were distinctly meant for the faculty member you want to work with. That way they will feel a connection with you right off the bat and will be interested in you.

Is this kind of the answer you were looking for??",0.3789,0.5758,0.0454

There should be a name associated with the posting and what I tend to do is call the number if there is one and if I don’t see one, I look that person up on LinkedIn and find other associated workers and let them know I was interested in a job at their job’s location. I think in most cases they respond back. In those cases, ask to see if you can make a quick phone call with them (have your speech ready). I’ve applied to ~15 positions (some internships and some work-study) on HAL alone and I’ve heard back from ~6. The rest took my initiative to get a response. When I took the initiative after not hearing back, I was glad to hear I landed a job off campus doing work-study where they paid $15/hr. My personal experience with this is that HAL is UT’s database and when you submit a formal application, it goes to the job’s (work-study/non work-study, internship) portal. I’m thinking that maybe when you submit your application, it doesn’t notify them but rather it takes the recruiters initiative (and this usually only happens when they have little applications coming in) to check the applications. I’m thinking they do so arbitrarily. So call them and prepare to talk about yourself. Show them you WANT the job and you would work as hard as it takes to get it. 

Another way is directly contacting the company and this is also preferable because some say contacting via likedIn before meeting face to face has some impact on their decision to continue with your app.

However, I do encourage you to go to the SI sessions after he's given you the 6 prompts because they will go over at least half of them and that is a great starting point for your planning (also that is the same TA who's going to grade your essay so you could figure out exactly what they're looking for!).

That is not True at all. I think the ranking system is broken. Even Ivy League schools will look at your rank and students who perform well (but not at the highest level) in their school get overlooked by both UT and those selective schools. While an argument can be made that they have a lot of options financially, it doesn't make sense for anyone to go to a school that's on par with UT in every way while paying more money for it. Here's a thought: why don't we take out ranking and test scores and just look at GPA, ECs, recommendations and essays for prospective students?

The reason is simple: the number of in-state applicants that meet the percentage criteria increases every year. As for the reason behind the rule: the UT education system was created to serve texans, specifically. Texas is a consistently low income state throughout our history and many high school students could not and still can't afford to think about college (speaking from experience- I come from an extremely impoverished community). So, the state decided to create UT to serve these students. I am not saying the system is perfect, but I think it has provided more educational opportunities for Texans and has proved to be somewhat resistant to increases in national tuition rates (excluding out of state residents --I think the out-of-state tuition is outrageous).",0.1265,0.487,0.3865

Two of the coaches are brown belts and one is a purple belt, and all of us train at a gym in south Austin called Integração Jiu Jitsu. Most of the members of the club are pretty new to jiu jitsu, so it’s very beginner-friendly.

I tried negotiating at first but they outright refused any arrangement like paying 1-2 months of rent as a penalty. They only allowed me to break the lease once I made my intention to leave and they found a replacement themselves. The lease itself is also written really predatory -- technically you owe the entire year's rent upon signing but get to pay in ""installments"" rather than rent. Basically it's more like financing a car than renting an apartment. 

Anyway if worse comes to worse you probably can't get out of it legally, if neither of you can find a replacement they will send the rest of your lease to collections. Which isn't the worse thing in the world but probably not worth the headache",0.0265,0.208,0.7655

There are weekly department-wide research seminars in addition to weekly seminars more focused on particular subfields. There are several organizations you can get involved in as a graduate student (Women in Physics, Graduate Welfare Committee, etc.), and I know many people have found close groups of friends in the department. 

The website's accuracy is spotty, so for up-to-date information on research groups I recommend emailing faculty or current students directly.

When you apply, be aware that you'll be invited for your visit _before_ you know whether you've been admitted.

Student government tried to make a campus wide test bank several years ago but the initiative was stopped by administration because it is apparently too difficult for STEM professors to generate new questions on the same material every semester.

Students who share tests are contributing to grade inflation by providing others with inside information prior to examinations. Those that receive payment for uploading material to Koofers are also infringing on the test creator's intellectual property. 

All because many students use unauthorized practice tests, even good students or those that do so unknowingly, and that it is difficult to prevent does not make the action permissible nor ethical. Ideally, your test grades should reflect your understanding of provided course material without prior knowledge of what questions will be asked. Rationalizations that doing so is necessary to achieve your desired grade, to get into grad school, be competitive for jobs, or because your instructor is bad will not help you in the long run.

5361,"I really feel for you. I came into UT as a liberal arts major, and was really excited when I switched into AET (music production emphasis) when they offered the major for the first time my sophomore year. After a semester of classes, with the exception of an intro to adobe cc class with Neal, I felt like I wasn’t learning anything. The colloquium class was a joke, and i could go on and on about how jack stamps is not a good fit for the music production program. Generally, it seemed to me and my AET friends that the professors were a bunch of weird, out-of-touch “artists”, which constantly frustrated us because we wanted education/training for work in creative arts/tech industries. After a year in AET, I ended up switching back to my liberal arts major and, luckily with my degree plan, I just had all those classes count for a minor in AET, so I was still able to graduate in 4 years. I switched back to liberal arts just because I felt like it would teach me something and be more marketable of a degree. I’m so glad I switched out. The way I see it, this is the time you should be learning/growing/making connections, not just breezing through all your classes. If it’s not going to set you back graduation time-wise, go for whatever major you think will grow your skillset/get you those opportunities you want.

It’s just a matter of whether or not her time with a reduced workload counts toward that time served as as an assistant prof.

1) you always have right of way at 4 way stop sign intersections, so matter how big the truck is.

3) you always have right of way at marked pedestrian crossings. If you’re standing in the street and crossing, cars are required to fully stop for you. They don’t always like to fully stop, but you have the right to walk in front of them. Cars around campus aren’t super informed about this rule.

Likewise, you should know these rules as a driver so you don’t end up looking like an asshole cutting off a pedestrian.

5602,"It’s definitely appropriate— they encourage anyone to come.

5603,"Edit: incoming essay, I apologise for the length of my comment. I clearly have a lot of feelings.

Current AET senior. I went through this dilemma myself, I ultimately stayed because I figured it was better to graduate in 4 years than to go through hell trying to get into Comp Sci and potentially tank my GPA and not even get in to the program. The classes get better (I'm not what year you are, but the upper division classes tend to be a lot more interesting, at least in GAMMA).

Looking back, I do regret not trying to switch into CS, and that's a decision that may cause regret for me for the foreseeable future. I discovered too late that it's not *as* difficult (though it certainly is difficult, don't get me wrong)  to get into a competitive major like CS, and I probably had the work ethic and skills to be able to do it, but fear stopped me from doing it. I do regret that choice, so the first thing you should ask yourself is: will you feel the way I do when you're a senior looking back on your college experience and looking forward towards your post-graduation life?

It's not a bad program, I think, and it's come a long ways. But it certainly has a long ways to go, especially when compared to any other program at UT. There are quite a few professors and program heads that clearly don't have the expertise or knowledge they need for such an interdisciplinary major and they really hold back the program because many of them teach several required classes in the curriculum. I've seen several scenarios where students are more qualified to be teaching a course than the professor themselves, and this is the only program I'm aware of where that's not uncommon. Again, this is changing and in the past 2 years there have been a lot of great new hires bringing a lot of life to the program, but it's still a problem. The capstone options are and have been a major point of contention for seniors, because of certain people involved with those courses.

In general, if you're expecting to go into AET and graduate and get a decent job, look elsewhere. None of the people I know that graduated this past May are directly applying the skills they developed in AET (though I concede this is a small and biased dataset and therefore probably means next to nothing). And I don't know anyone from GAMMA (my focus) working in the game industry. I'm sure there are some, but in general the game industry is volatile and favors experience above all, which AET majors don't have because we don't get internships. To date, I have heard of one person getting an internship of any note in the game industry. And they seemed to work their ass off for it, on top of being naturally skilled in their domain.

Fact is, any degree from UT looks good. It can get you a long ways towards a good career. But with AET, you are going to need to do work outside of college to learn skills that you can apply to the field you're interested in. For me, that's computer science, so I am doing the elements of computing certificate (which is taking me a long ways, it's a great program) and took online CS courses, did side projects for fun, etc, and I am now in an IT and Management masters of science program at UT for next year, which will really give me the skills and expertise I never got in AET (not to mention a career services team that do more than send out a monthly email with positions irrelevant to what I want to do) that I can apply to a field I'm actually interested in and have a realistic shot of building a career in.

I'm going to be honest, now that I'm looking towards getting into the field of data engineering, my AET classes feel like a waste of time because they are just no longer relevant to my end goals. I have learned a lot in the program and had some great experiences and gained a lot of knowledge, and I'm sad I may never apply most if not all of that knowledge, but I'm on a better path towards my True goal which is to have a stable career in a field that interests me and lets me live comfortably. Your goals may be different, and you need to assess those and figure out what's important to you and what isn't.

I know I dogged a lot on the major, because I do think it has serious problems that need to be addressed candidly, but I'm sure for a lot of people, it's a great program and they probably had a very different experience. **I want to stress that all of what I said above is anecdotal and could be completely different from other peoples' experiences.**

I think the end all be all is that while AET is an interdisciplinary major, it's **highly** niche and you need to consider that greatly.

You just have to know if it's right for you and your goals. Is it worth switching majors to something else that you enjoy more and find more challenging/rewarding, or would you rather stay and do what I did to find ways to supplement your degree in the field you're interested in to make you more hireable/to be able to achieve your True life goals?

5788,"My friend and I both really enjoyed it! A lot of it is participation, like you have to post to the discussion board on canvas about the readings every once in awhile. Tbh I bsed my way through most of the readings (read shmoop, watched 3-minute videos on yt, etc) and was fine. I also remembered things better with the modern and clear way shmoop explains things. 

The exams have some multiple choice about the readings, but it's not super specific, and two free response questions. For those, you can choose which readings to use, so as long as you're familiar with about 3 at each exam and can make them work with the prompts, you'll be okay. There is also some discussion of ancient Greek and Roman culture for context, but it's not in depth. 

Since the class has an ethics flag, there's a good bit about of systematic moral analysis throughout applied to the readings. It's pretty much opinion-based on how much harm was done or avoided by a character's actions, so as long as you understand a few key terms, you just have to argue your point. I have a learning disability and get confused while reading easily, so I would discuss the plot of the readings with other people when I was confused. That helped me a lot and I (somehow) ended up with an A-. 

Basically you need to learn the overall plot of the readings, a bit about the characters, and what ancient Greek and Roman people prioritized, and understand the way ethics is talked about in the class. If you dog that and can write coherently, you'll be just fine. I'm pretty sure almost no one failed the class. Since you took cc 302, it's probably similar. You need to put in at least a bit of effort, but for me it wasn't bad at all.

Most community colleges combine chem classes with the labs, so it would be hard to get CH 104N by itself, but you could check to see if Collin offers credit for the lab alone.

If you need CH 302, you could take it in the summer at Collin and get credit for your missing 104N.

If you are taking CH 302 at UT, you could take CH 204 at UT concurrently or anytime after.

Check with your academic advisor about the best path for you. (In the past, physics majors needed CH 204, but the department accepted CH 104M, or the equivalent. I doubt other majors would accept just half the lab, but your advisor would know.)

5901,"I'm a freshman in CS right now so I don't have that much experience but it's pretty nice so far. 

The lectures are full in CS314 &amp; CS311 (some of your first cs classes) but so far my professors are awesome. Additionally you have to take something called a ""UGS"" class (Undergraduate signature course) where you can either choose a lecture-like class or a small class with like 20 people that focuses more on writing. It's just a nice break from the 150 people in my CS section.

It's not that bad though. In CS we have this thing called a POD (other majors generalize it to FIG, Freshman Interest Group) which is optional but assigned to each freshman where you meet with like 20 others and a junior/senior leads the group and gives you tips on being a cs major. Like right now we're covering just how to make your resume for the career fair this week. There's snacks and pizza and stuff and it's really fun. You also have like TA sessions where a teaching assistant will do bonus problems in each of your STEM classes.

I'm not sure if competitive is the right word for my group I've found vs like academically focused? Like it's not I've-got-mine kinda attitude so far but more like I'ma do a slight flex for getting the assignment done ahead of time. Sometimes people will snicker at your questions in class or make fun of your questions on Piazza but most people are really chill and that's probably a thing at most school cause people can be dicks without meaning to hurt others (we're all just trying to see what works rn). I haven't talked to someone that was mean to me face-to-face at least.

My professors are awesome though. You'll take Michael Scott in at least 1 class if you're non-honors (it's hard to get into honors, so don't feel bad if you don't) and he's super funny and considerate. I have Kathy Davis for Calculus who includes a fun story and rants against WolframAlpha every lecture, and a super caring and positive dude for my UGS class.

The classes are no joke but I don't feel overwhelmed as of yet and everything feels fair as in no busy work or bs grades. If you make sure you're doing the work I think you'll be fine (though that's coming from someone not scarred by CS 439 yet &gt;_&gt;)

When I was applying to college UT was the last on my mind and I won't lie and say it wasn't kinda disappointing, but after coming here and seeing the cool perks and classes for cs so far (and it still being like top 10 in the country for CS) it's a pretty sweet gig.

5941,"To add on to this, I graduated in EE last December, and have been working for a large aerospace company since. I've always been interested in airplanes, and still want to get a glider license and/or PPL in the future, but I've already realized this industry isn't where I want to be in the long term. Obviously the aircraft you'll work around are some of the most technologically advanced machines on the planet, but especially starting out, your role is a very small one in that massively complicated whole. The bureaucracy is something you'll probably hear about even in school, but it's hard to convey the exhaustion of going through endless pages of utterly monotonous standards, reports, documentation, etc., until you experience it yourself. I appreciate how a large part of it is necessary in the aerospace industry, but at the end of the day, cool aircraft or not, I can't say it brings me much personal satisfaction (which granted, has a good amount to do with my specific role). All this is to say I'm glad I have the flexibility of electrical engineering to fall back on to find jobs in other industries down the road. You can read more about my personal experience in this [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/c2b466/achieved_my_childhood_dream_of_working_in/).

Perhaps it's too early for you now, but like the above comment, I'd encourage you nonetheless to think about your personal ethics when it comes to defense-oriented aerospace companies.

* By majoring in ASE, you're shoehorning yourself into one industry, so don't do ASE unless you're 100% sure of working in Aerospace, which is honestly stupid to ask of freshmen. You aren't *beholden* to ASE industry, it certainly possible to branch out, it's just harder to do so than other majors
* Most of the professors are fair and helpful. A few are hardasses (Sirohi, Rodin) that will make your life hell. Sirohi is still a chill dude though, just hate his fucking classes oh my god. But overall it's not *that* hard to have a high GPA in this major as long as you put in the necessary work and study responsibly.
* it's a small major so you'll probably recognize everyone. kind of awkward if you're not the social type or most of your friends aren't in aerospace.
* don't challenge yourself academically if you don't have to, e.g. don't willingly take a harder professor, don't take a hard class if you don't need to, etc. Challenge yourself extracurricularly in ways that won't hurt your GPA.
* There are 2 tracks, atmosphere and space. Atmosphere is actually pretty fucking hard because the design class isn't a joke. Space track is relatively way easier, and honestly what track you take doesn't really matter in the long run, it's what your experience is that really matters. Sooooooo just do space even if you want to do planes lol.
* Taking into account the last two points, extracurriculars are really important for internships/jobs/research. Get involved ASAP.
* Before switching to ASE think about who you want to work for. A lot of ASE companies literally profit off war (Lockheed, Raytheon, Northrop, Boeing to an extent). If you do space, you're probably going to be working for the government or government contractors (unless you're a stud and cop a SpaceX/Blue Origin job. But then rip your career/life balance).
* If robotics is your thing, a lot of autonomous work and research is done in the ASE department. It's really cool and a nice alternative to just the atmosphere and space stuff that most students do.
* TL;DR it's an OK major. It's not bad at all but it's not the best. I personally wish I did CS, MechE, or EE, but I don't regret majoring in Aerospace. If it's really what you want to do, go for it  :\^)",0.2442,0.4114,0.3444

- bread does not make you fat. Unless you are eating like 3,000 calories worth of bread. 

The body LOVES glucose, as it is the brain's favorite energy source. 
 Actually, if you don't eat enough carbohydrates, the body will convert protein into glucose. This is called gluconeogenisis. This is why going ""keto"" is not a good idea. You may not be eating carbs, but your body is making them anyways, so you might as well eat that bread.

- protein is toxic to the body in high amounts. You don't need to eat excess protein to bulk. 

- 20g of whey protein pretty much meets the leucine threshold. You need to eat meals/snacks that meet the threshold about 3-4 times a day. (The same amount of protein in about 4 oz of steak, or 5 eggs) You only need a certain amount to gain muscle. So yeah, about 0.7 g/lb is about right.  After that, the excess protein you eat just stresses your kidneys and causes excess urine production. (The point is that you don't need to be drinking nothing but protein shakes) 

- eat something sweet after working out. The spike in insulin stimulates muscle protein synthesis. (mTOR pathway is stimulated by leucine and leucine)

I got super lucky during college as  I made really good group of friends. It also didn’t hurt that I had a lot of close friends from my high school come to UT. However, the best thing you can do is join clubs/extracurricular activities. Just keep going to them, go to everything you can, stay as long as you can(don’t run out the door when the meetings “end”). It can be really awkward but honestly that’s how meeting new people is. Eventually they’ll mention a group me or a fb group they are all in or something similar. Join it! 

The thing about our generation is that no one wants to seem “clingy” or “pushy” but it’s dumb. No one hangs out with others until someone says “hey lets hang out”. It might be awkward at first but like I said, it’s all awkward, everyone’s awkward, we are 20 something years old. To make it less awkward try to invite 1-2 friends you already know and invite 1-2 new people. That way you aren’t bearing all the awkwardness and it’s easier to mingle. 

Depending on your major there are a lot of social orgs. I was mechanical engineering so ASME was an easy place to start. I didn’t really do asme stuff until my junior year! But I made some good friends through the org!

6189,"For sure! So basically I thought the same thing, and so we talked to this agent who we’ll call Taylor. Taylor had told us that our leasing for sharing a room with  another person would be exactly half the price of leasing solo. $1300/2=$650 plus a one time solo occupancy fee! What a steal for such a nice place in West campus right? Well, turns out he had told us all of this verbally, therefore it wasn’t documented. Leases came  for us at full price ($1300) and he had told us not to worry, that in the upcoming month they’d be updated to be the $650 we had talked about. We trusted him, just thought that since they were under new management they just had to update leases for people in our special scenario. Lease comes around, and they’re priced at $850 a month, which is way over what we had come to terms with, but because we were under the legal terms of the first lease, we had to sign it because we cannot afford the $1300. We tried to talk to the management about our situation, but they had told us unless we had documentation, they could not do anything. We were going to sue using UT legal services because their contract also states that you’re not allowed to change the terms or pricing at any time, but we never got a reply and have no way of paying for a lawyer.

TL:DR We were deceived and denied any sort of compensation for our situation, so now we feel like we are way over paying for a tiny little apartment (feels tiny when you have twice the amount of people it’s built for) and sleeping in bunk beds for $850/month, when you can find way better and larger places for less in North campus.

6199,"Reality about partying in UT:

•Parties are mostly dull in campus. These all end for the most part at 1 AM (completely stupid, especially after considering they start at 10 PM)

•Only lit and ""college experience"" parties around UT are Frat and Sorority ones, and the only way to getting in them is either being part of the Frat/Sorority or being a skinny White Girl with your white friends. Or paying like $100 to get in (I have heard stories like this which I think it is pretty lame). Even then, being in the family doesn't guarantee great parties all the time. I have noticed some of the worst parties having being done within frats, like literally just 10 people dancing to stupid music and getting wasted in the House.

•After Frat parties, there are either Orgs or ""Frat"" parties that welcome everyone for the hefty fee of $10-$25 (girls free or reduced). I put ""Frat"" in quotation because these are not real frats, just some random frats made by a group of friends. You will see many of these such as Gamma Beta, Omegas, Alpha Sigma, Skullz, and a bunch of others. These fall along the same category as Orgs such as FSA, Latin Longhorns, Planet Longhorn, etc that only make parties for collecting money for their expenditures. These are all the parties you will be most likely attending, which are fine but you won't get the full experience of a real Frat party and also don't expect any of these making parties for the Public all the time (they also do kinda the same scheduling as the former Frats I mentioned above with the exception they do let people in at times).

•Spirit groups fall in a gray area between the two above. They are sort of like a Frat/Sorority but operate kind of like an Org sort of set up so expect a lot of their parties to be at rooftops or small houses.

•Those Parties GroupMes are lame but a bit useful once in a blue moon (those are mostly dedicated to people who cant get into frat parties for whatever racial/social reason). The parties they sometimes include are the ones above with Public access, but for the most part they are some random ass dull parties.

•After Greek Life, there are the Co-Op parties. I personally disliked them the most, though some of them were nice, but these are very weird and you never know what to expect (a plus or a con?). Basically it is an Indie meet up for alternative people. You will find Weed and Beer. Rarely Spirits. You have higher chances of finding Psychs in here. It feels as if you were in a compact Woodstock along a bunch of Hipster music ranging from Indie rock (the most part) to some weird ass Electronic exposition (which is what I vibe to). They also did some Rap/Trap rehearsals which were lit. If you are one of those that came to ATX for the ""Live Music"" thing, Co-Ops are for you.

•The chillest and safest parties there are the ones in your friends apt's (by this I mean they might not be the best but you will for sure know the party will be lit and will be with known friends).

•Finally, 6th is the safest ""getting lit"" bet. Waiting to turn 21 really pays off. Or go to the 18+ clubs drunk already. Expect to pay a hefty fee though.",0.0406,0.2335,0.7259

First semester CS312

Second semester: CS314 + CS311

Third semester: CS429

After CS429, you can take whatever CS upper division classes (assuming you have prereq) but need 2 more required classes, CS439 and CS331, these can be in whatever order, usually you take CS439 right after CS429 due to overlap of material. Some also take CS331 and CS439 together though few. 

You can only take 3 CS classes per semester with exception for your last/graduating semester where they'll allow you to take 4 only if you ask in order to graduate. Otherwise 3 is the hard limit and I definitely don't recommend 4 as a lot end up dropping at least one anyways.

6374,"It sounds like you're pretty sold on where you're at, and you shouldn't leave where you're happy because of your friends or boyfriend. I transferred in from Kansas State after two years there, into the Natural Sciences program -- I didn't last in NS, and wound up in Liberal Arts. 

But, I loved all my discussion classes because they gave me time to actually talk through the material and hear the perspectives of other students on the class topics. It's a really valuable form of learning and it was different than just being lectured to and having to retain that knowledge through notes. It helped me learn how to express my thoughts and opinions better than I'd been doing, which has helped me immensely in my work post-college. Don't knock discussion classes! Just change your mindset about them. 

UT is a huge campus. There are 50,000+ students, an army of administrative staff to keep the campus city running, and a full fleet of faculty. It absolutely is hard to make friends and connections, especially if you transfer in and just expect socialization to land in your lap. This is the time in your life when you start to realize you have to work for your relationships, and that is hard to navigate in a place this size. But there are hundreds of clubs, there are people you'll meet in class that you can get close to and keep in touch with if you want. In my experience, after a semester was over, if I didn't make the effort to set up lunches or study sessions, I lost those connections. Greek Life seems to be a massive factor in the close knit groups, but I wasn't interested in that, and ultimately tt wasn't the end of the world because I had socialization outside of campus with people not in my academic circle.

The professors here are phenom. I've kept in touch with a few of mine, and the ones I currently work with are all incredible academics. Your mileage may vary depending on what department you'd be getting your major in. 

UT's been my home for a long time, and I enjoyed being here so much I got a job on campus. Your time here, if you transfer, will be what *you* make of it. It's taken a lot of work for me to be happy here, both socially and literally, and I had to be willing to put in the time to make it so (which was extremely difficult some days, not going to lie).",0.546,0.3511,0.1029

It makes me feel like I matter, I'm cared for, and that I can look forward to sharing my experiences with others.

I have stopped making an effort with my friends because I was always the facilitator and it got tiring, and I realized that nobody was reciprocating any of the effort I was putting into friendships, so I finally decided to just drop them.

I have talked to a lot of people, and it unfortunately seems common at UT for people to be generally not genuine in their friendships and flaky as fuck.

I mean I get it, a lot of us are really busy in our programs. But I know people way busier than me in programs 10x harder than me that do more social/recreational activities in a week than I do in a month. It is possible to be social, even at UT, but so many people choose to just use ""I'm busy with school"" as a constant weak ass excuse to not hang out with someone and avoid being honest with them.

I understand cancelling plans last minute or being ""too busy"" to hang out *every once in a while*, but when it happens for weeks or months on end, you start to realize your worth to those people.

When watching during lecture, don't take any notes. Just try to absorb as much as possible. Then, the night/morning before your next class (and the benchmark), re-watch and take notes when you can pause so that you can be more thorough. I know this takes a lot of time and feels silly, but I found myself doing a lot better after doing so. Also, because there were no exams in the class and this was really all I had to do to prep, it really wasn't that big of an investment. 

On additional problems you miss, make sure you really double check to see if it was actually a valid question.

I've made a pretty great group of friends (as a relatively shy person) and am very happy at UT Austin.

I usually get fresh broccoli and green beans which you can cook into things like rice, pasta, or just eat it plain.

You can't just divide that $12k by 9 and say that's the amount PER MONTH that you would pay in an apartment because when you live in an apartment you are committed to a year long lease with 12 installments NOT just 9 installments. That's why you have to take the TOTAL COST of living in the dorm and compare to the TOTAL COST of living in an apartment.

If the total cost of living in Jester for the school year is $12k (and that includes utilities and food), then you can only spend $12k for apartment living (including utilities and food) for it to be equal.",0.052,0.43,0.5181

I can't really say I was happy before coming here, but it was because I was in a horrible home situation, but I didn't feel the disappointment that I do attending this school. One thing that I have going for me is that change doesn't bother me. I don't mind going through the trouble of staring over at all. I've been here a year and when I started attending therapy a long time ago I tried to change my outlook on this place and try to convince myself to feel good but I can't force it.

6587,"I live there.

1) independent landlords are totally hit or miss. maintenance is usually slow.

2) the HOA manager person and the on site maintenance guy (not for your apt's stuff, just the complex's) never communicate at all. this can result in the water being out for 24 hrs and the HOA person calling you a liar when you phone it in. the only fast response I got out of them was when I complained about a wasp nest being built and mentioned I was deadly allergic. 

3) they always schedule fire inspections during spring finals, but occasionally they'll forget to put up notices until the day before.

4) the HOA person is fine-happy. pretty sure her life purpose is to fine people. I saw her when my neighbor left 2 garbage bags outside their apt, and she spent 3 mins accusing me of doing it until I showed her my garbage bags were different. she looked super happy as she filled out notes to fine them $200+$75(? might have been more than this). The $200 was for 2 bags x $100 each. The $75 was because they weren't present to let extra inspectors in after the fire inspection that morning concluded. the extra inspection was unannounced.

5) the water infrastructure here sucks. eventually, your cold water pipes, somewhere and somehow, will clog with calcium buildup and your only options for showering or washing your hands will be a light, cool drizzle, or a fucking flaming waterfall.

6) birds nest here in the spring sometimes. I think they're cute, but they are annoying when they wake you up.

7) you have 2 internet choices: 5 mbps at&amp;t and 200 mbps TWC for $30/month and $40/month, respectively. it sounds like a total no-brainer, but TWC likes dropping connection a lot with random unscheduled maintenance right when you need the internet most (e.g. working on a paper at 1 AM). 

8) the complex perpetually feels like it's falling apart. I remember a year or so ago, a pipe burst and flooded half the apartments on my floor so bad insurance had to get involved (renter's and homeowner's). for a while during my first year living here, other pipes in the garage would burst randomly and trigger the fire alarms. 

9) the maintenance contractors they get are both shitty at their jobs and thieves. they sanded out the ceiling I think(?) so bad that my door, 2 years after the fact, still shows signs of dust being ground on it (scratched to hell doorknob, etc.). the 2nd one is anecdotal, but the 1 time I've had a package stolen in 3 years living here, it was during the only time maintenance was happening. I found my package torn open on the nearest stairs a floor down, empty. 

10) landlords here are cheap and lazy generally. one neighbor I had's landlord was using the cheapest fucking painters for their unit. I had to stay with a friend for a couple nights because of how strong the smell of paint thinner in my apartment was.
another unit had its fire alarm going off a couple summers ago for about 2 days straight even after I bugged my landlord and the hoa person to get in touch with whoever the fuck owned the apartment to stop it. 

end) I will say this tho: very few bugs in my apt, which is nice. but I'm pretty sure an apt near mine has a crazy ant infestation or st, because when I see a bug, 9/10 times it's one of those little shits (google crazy ants and electronics if you wanna know why this is concerning). before anyone asks, yes, I'm sure. they have the right coloring, the right gait, and the right size. they also don't have a noticeable bite/a proclivity to bite, like most of the little shits tend to have.

end2) we're right by a frat house or st. it's a very rare week if your desk doesn't shake from the bass of whatever they're playing at least once.",0.1018,0.2843,0.6139
6588,"I don't think they were trying to be rude. I think their point was simply that they suspect the reason why your unhappy has nothing to do with the school. That's not to say that your reasons for wanting to leave aren't valid and that you wouldn't be better off at another school. It could very well be that as far as accomplishing certain academic and career orientated goals, you are going to be better off at another university. But just because some other school is a better fit for you, doesn't mean you will necessarily be happy there. Happiness isn't about what happens to you, it's a mindset. It's about how you react to the things that happen to you. Mainly though, it all boils down from removing negativity from your life. So for me that meant two things. One, I deleted most of my social media accounts (I found deleting twitter to be the most beneficial) and two, I tried to spin every minor inconvenience that happened to me into a positive. If the food at the dining hall sucked, instead of complaining about it for an hour like I normally would, I just reminded myself of how great my life must be going and how lucky I must be if the worst thing that happened to me all day was being presented with bad tasting (although perfectly healthy and edible) food. Or if I bumped into someone, and spilled food on my shirt, instead of cursing them out in my head and brooding over it for a while, I just tried to laugh it off, hoping that it would make a good story or conversation starter later on. Obviously I'm not you, and I can't get inside your head and figure out why you aren't happy, but I think if you tried to find the positive in some of these negative views you hold about the school, then you will be substantially happier overall. Don't bemoan the fact that the student population is so big that you can't get into your classes. Yes, that's True, but for the time being you can't do anything about it. But you can take advantage of the school size, by say, joining clubs that wouldn't exist at smaller schools or watching high-level athletic competitions or plays that wouldn't be available at a smaller, more rural school. Instead of lamenting being in a city, take advantage of all the things Austin has to offer. Even if you would prefer to not be in a city, recognize that you can't do anything besides dropping out to change that at this very moment, and it stead enjoy the convenience of everything there is to do here (including a number of good hiking trails if that's the kind of thing your into.

Again, none of this is to say that you shouldn't transfer out. If the size impacts your ability to get the education you want, if you would prefer to be in a more rural area, if you want a school with better student services, then I sincerely wish you the best of luck in finding a place that serves you perfectly. Just know that UT probably isn't why you're unhappy, and that changing schools isn't going to immediately make you happy (I know this from personal experience). If you don't believe me, then ask yourself whether or not you were truly happy before you came here, if the answer is yes, then I'll gladly admit that I'm probably wrong. But if the answer is no, then transferring might not be the solution (or at least not the entire solution).",0.2317,0.4875,0.2808

1. 2013-2014 started classes at UT as a sophomore (transferred). Received a full ride. Finished first two semesters with around a 3.9 gpa. 

2. Late 2014. Girlfriend dumped me, so I went off the deep end and ended up getting kicked out of my study abroad program in China. Came back to US broke and with my scholarship in jeopardy. 

3. 2014-2015. Failed to finish a single semester without dropping classes, lost my scholarship, then blew through financial aid like there was no tomorrow. Some for legitimate reasons, some on alcohol. Gained 50 pounds. car was repossessed because I couldn’t swing 400 bucks lol. 

4. 2016-2018. Got a job at a grocery store. Wasted a year playing video games at my moms house, but held on. Decided to get it together in early 2018 and eventually built my credit up a bit. Got into excellent shape and bought a used car. 

5. 2019 spring. Went back to UT using credit cards. Took 2 chinese classes and an easy science class. Worked part time. As soon as the semester started, gf dumped me, and I went crazy. 

6. This march. Surrounded by police at work and thrown In the looney bin. Apparently I have borderline personality disorder. Had to drop out again, ruined my credit and another persons credit in the process—the same person who helped me go back to school. 

7. 2019 summer. Quit my job on a whim because I was angry and became a janitor at the airport for a few weeks. Quit that to work in a call center—I quit last week due to a pay dispute. 

8. Now. Liver hurts, gotta find a temp job and hope I don’t get pulled over for not having car insurance so my vehicle doesn’t get impounded. 

5 years ago I had a lot of prospects, but for some reason I mentally imploded over  abandonment issues and now my life is in ruins. Much of it was self-sabotage, but  I have a lot of problems from living in poverty and having an extremely dysfunctional childhood. I’m extremely mentally ill, but there’s no medication for a personality disorder.

6668,"I think it's cool that you want to learn and understand the game! Here are a few general areas where coaches get second guessed:

1. **going for the 1st down on 4th and X yards and NOT getting the 1st down.**  There are ""standard"" or ""accepted""  times for going for it on 4th and X such as late in the game when you are down in score but when coaches do this in non-standard situations and fail it gets complaints.
2. **doing trick plays that fail.** A ""trick"" play is something that is not the usual ""quarterback gets the ball and hands off to the running back or throws a pass"". An example is the play that involved 3 handoffs with the ball finally going back to Ehlinger who threw the ball. That play worked -- all three handoffs succeeded and the receiver caught the ball. But if it hadn't worked there would be complaints.
3. **Special teams play.** Special teams are the punt and kickoff teams. This should always be a no brainer but when the punt, kick, punt return or kick return get screwed up that is always a point of complaints
4. **Running the ball when you think they should have thrown/Throwing the ball when you think they should have run.** This one is a little trickier to explain :-)

You'll notice on #1 and #2 that these things are bad if they fail but ""brilliant"" if they work!! :-)

There is a very famous football coach from the 1970s -- John Madden (you may recognize the name from the football video game). He always said ""Take the points"". That relates to what should you do when you are 4th and X in the ""red zone"" (i.e., close to scoring). His theory was ALWAYS TAKE THE POINTS instead of going for the 1st down (or touchdown if 4th and goal). Again, that advice is not for the end of the game when you are down in points but for earlier in the game.

As an example, the LSU game. Texas had TWO scoring opportunities very early in the game and went for 4th and X (were they both 4th and goal?) and went for it instead of taking the easy 3 points from a field goal. That cost them 6 points! Personally, I think this affected the game result and it might have been different if they had taken the points. Other people will say that they had to go for it because LSU is a good team.",0.1161,0.4438,0.4401

Les Trente Glorieuses (French pronunciation: ​[le tʁɑ̃t ɡlɔʁjøz], 'The Glorious Thirty') was the thirty years from 1945 to 1975 following the end of the Second World War in France. The name was first used by the French demographer Jean Fourastié. Fourastié coined the term in 1979 with the publication of his book Les Trente Glorieuses, ou la révolution invisible de 1946 à 1975 ('The Glorious Thirty, or the Invisible Revolution from 1946 to 1975'). The term is derived from Les Trois Glorieuses ('The Glorious Three'), the three days of revolution on 27–29 July 1830 in France.

This allowed for 3 things: large groups of ppl...who had good likelihood of running into each other repeatedly...and had plenty of free time to socialize due to their payInitially / lack of stress / lack of not needing to worry about their “career progression”.

World War II was a big social glue that held society together too. Although the Army wasn’t racially integrated it was the first time America had been so massively integrated along class/wealth lines. I mean JFK, the playboy son of a billionaire, was captain of a PT Boat where I think only one guy had actually finished all of high school. 

Also the focus on individual identity, finding your “inner self”, meditation, etc starting in the 70’s...while a natural response to the conformity of the 50’s, made ppl a lot less social. 

Then all the WWII ppl start dying and there relationships that held everything together go with it. 

Then finally by the 1973-1974 oil crisis and the end of the https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trente_Glorieuses a lot of bad things socially start happening.

6810,"I dropped out of MechE after my freshman year. Sucked ass at first because it was a mixture of not taking my classes too seriously but also I became $10k in debt and financial troubles kept me super paranoid and depressed about not even trying in classes. 


I currently have a cad job in a steel company in Dallas that pays $18/hr so I guess it was probably one of the best decisions of my life. I still visit Austin every weekend because of my girlfriend and I miss Austin a shit ton but I know my place in life isn't there anymore. If you try hard to build experience and are willing to work shitty jobs until you climb a ladder somewhere then do it. I worked in the warehouse cleaning steel for 1st shift and it was awful. I still did it though because without going to school back again, I needed money.


If you're willing to put in the work and try hard to show these industries you care about working well and getting any sort of education in that field, you can go far. I make good money and do something I really enjoy. I wanted to do design in ut so it's perfect for me. Keep your head and take it ONE DAY AT A TIME. Part of my depression after dropping out is just that I constantly kept looking way too far into the future when it's all shit you cant predict. Do what you need to do and don't fret about others. Focus on yourself and what happiness is to you. You are what you are. UT isn't who you are no matter what anyone says. You are what you do, not what you attend. My happiness comes from seeing my healthy family everyday and seeing my girlfriend when I can. Happiness is whatever you choose it to be and if you ever put your eggs in one basket, you're fucked when that basket is ripped away from you, whether it's your fault our not.


Sorry this was really long, I've just been struggling when I first dropped out but I reached a great point in my happiness and I don't want anyone else to feel what I felt after what happened to me. Best of luck to you and to anyone who bothers to read this",0.3621,0.3525,0.2853

So first you do interviews with various Japanese companies and then you get placed with whichever company accepts you. Therefore, the internship experience varies. For example, I interned at a very chill, international start-up tech company. It was mainly 60% internationals &amp; 40% Japanese, so we mainly spoke in English, but a lot of people did speak in Japanese. On the other hand, my friend interned at a traditional Japanese company with a Japanese boss and spoke a lot of Japanese, but that was something that he wanted and mentioned in his initial placement interview because he too wants to work in Japan someday so the whole internship was a great experience for him.

6975,"Full Context:

&gt;The Army is investigating “disturbing and very specific chatter in the dark web” about a possible movie theater shooting, but reported ties to Travis County appear to be a mistake.  
&gt;  
&gt;The original memo, prepared by a criminal intelligence analyst, said the Fort Sill CID received an intelligence bulletin about a “credible potential mass shooting to occur at an unknown movie theater during the release of the new Joker movie scheduled on October 4, 2019.”  
&gt;  
&gt;The memo said the information came from the Travis County Sheriff’s office, but TCSO spokeswoman Kristen Dark said an Army agent told her office “TCSO was accidentally credited for the information but that it was actually received from a different source.”  
&gt;  
&gt;U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command Chief of Public Affairs Chris Grey told KXAN the information actually came from the Texas Department of Public Safety Joint Crime Information Center.

Why do you want that experience? To make you a more valuable candidate, right? So keep trying for an internship (it's only September, plus the spring is easier to on hiring than the fall), but ask yourself what else you can do to make yourself more valuable. Take summer classes and get a minor/certificate (how I got my business minor), look up professional certification exams in your field that you can sit for (I'm taking the CFA level 1 next summer), or take online courses and work on a project that'll improve some aspect of someone's life (I built something for my night job that never got used, but it landed me an internship this past summer). Becoming valuable is something that happens incrementally, and people put SO MUCH emphasis on internships that they forget there are a million and one other ways to build your career capital. And also, those people you mentioned, who are doing crazy shit and look like they're flying? It's because they already put the effort in and did what we need to do, and you can be EXACTLY where they are before you graduate if you focus on making yourself valuable.

Chill out man, my only college internship was unpaid as a developer at the Long Center and I felt the same way with all the big name internships everyone around me had (especially the CS majors!). I entered my last semester with Walmart IT in Bentonville being my only secured job.

What changed is I started looking outside of UT's career resources where there's a million people just like you willing to do anything. I managed to land a ground level consulting job with a startup, and my career opened up from there. 

Sure, I don't really have any Googles or Microsofts on my resume, but I work from home, don't feel the kind of stress that working in corporate tech can put on individuals, and my career options are now so wide that recruiters won't STFU.

The industry is not in the greatest state and hasn't been for a few years. Yes, the Cockrell numbers show that PGE has the highest salaries but you also have to consider the fact that most PGE students are only gunning for one industry. In other words, a drilling engineer at Chevron who majored in mechanical is getting paid the same as his colleague who majored in petroleum. You could argue that PGE's have a higher chance of getting those upstream roles; I don't have numbers or stats to dispute that but based on personal/anecdotal experience, there are more than enough non-PGE employees holding those roles too.

Also, you cannot understate the flexibility that a more general/broad major can bring you. Your interests may change over time. The industry conditions may change over time. There's no saying what position you'll be in a couple years from now and the ability to pivot and have a wider array of options for you is pretty great. Plenty of PGE students can also pivot and go into non-traditional PGE roles (consulting, downstream, etc.) but in my opinion (emphasis on opinion), picking a more niche major closes some doors without opening as many more.

7157,"Your simplification of what the professor said for the title isn't quite the same as what the professor actually said -- in particular, you shortened ""making voluntary decisions"" to ""consent"".  The article you give makes a similar argument.

I think we're supposed to be mad at the professor for testifying in this manner, however ... what she said seems to me to be entirely correct, at least the part you quoted.  (Except for the last sentence, which was an ""educated guess"" at best.)  That said, she did *not* explicitly say that a blackout drunk person is able to legally consent, and ""conscious and making voluntary decisions but are not forming memories"" due to being blackout drunk falls pretty short from what is required to *legally* consent according to how the law has been enforced over the years.

That said, some jurors might decide that this means ""not rape"" (or at least that it provides ""reasonable doubt"") and that's what the defense is after.

All in all, that she's getting paid (a lot!) to defend ~~a rapist~~ many rapists is slimy, but ... her testimony appears to be technically accurate (though I question how True her ""guess"" was), and defendants are indeed entitled to a ""robust"" defense against criminal charges, so ... right or wrong, this is how our justice system works.",0.0769,0.4947,0.4284

Some suggestions:

* Join or start a campus group relating to a cool hobby you're excited about. I'm still really close friends with some people that I met through the UT Hammocking Club, and I'm about to move in with some of them in a cool East Austin home.

* Join a greater Austin meetup group that sounds fun. I have a couple great friends from the Secret Dining Club, where we just had dinners at random people's houses.

* Download the CouchSurfing app and check the calendar of events. Go on a hike. You will meet CouchSurfing hosts who are usually super extroverted and knowledgable about all things Austin, and CouchSurfing guests who are often travelers eager to meet new people. If you don't come away with new friends, you will at least come away excited about cool new things about Austin that you never knew before.

You can also search your hobbies on Facebook to find related groups. Into bicycling? You will find the Social Cycling Austin group that meets at minimum 3 times a week for a giant group bike ride. Climbing? There's a beginner-friendly rock climbing group. Knitting socks? There's probably one of those too.

7387,"A lot of pros and cons will come from your specific situation, such as career goals, money, etc. So you need to think about that a lot, but here's my pros and cons.

Pros:
 
- lots of people to meet and befriend (big school was a plus for me as a high schooler)

- lots of activities, classes, and career/research opportunities to do on campus

(personally, i dont think i could have gotten my job offer if weren't for the people I met and the networking opportunities) 

- easy and quick access to downtown Austin (6th street is nice) 

- Austin itself, a nice chill and laid back city 

- great professors

- in-state tuition  

- Bevo, Domino, Tower Girl falcon,and the turtle pond are absolutely the cutest

- memes 


Cons:

- fuckin heat

- fuckin allergies 

- not so great professors

- large class sizes can be imitating

- bureaucracy is annoying (switching to majors, especially to STEM, is difficult and annoying)
 

Hopefully these help and good luck on your decision!",0.7121,0.2358,0.0521

7487,"I'm glad that you are going to graduate in the college you want, and as I said, ""not everyone can or should finish in 4 years."" 

Getting through college if you come from a school that doesn't prepare you is difficult, but being dropped from your major is not a new thing, and it's happening a lot less than it used to.

In the 90s and early 00s, when the 4-year graduation rate was really low, (52%!!) there were many more students who didn't graduate at all, even after 6 years. Many students were permanently dismissed and can never graduate. This process isn't from struggling with some classes for one semester or two - it takes years to be permanently dismissed. 

No one gets pushed out of their college after one semester (although it's possible to get dismissed from the University for a semester if you earn all F grades in a full time schedule your first semester.) Most colleges give second and sometimes third chances, as they know how hard the adjustment can be. For example, students can only take a CNS course two times, and that's a roadblock for some majors. Repeats may be approved for non-academic reasons. The number of students who can't get through these courses after two attempts is now very small. 

UT's 1st year ""persistence rate"" is much higher than it used to be. This is the number of 1st year students who successfully get through their first two semesters without being on scholastic probation (or the number that return in the following fall.)

That being said attending a university of the caliber of UT will help you with job placement.  However, you will not receive a job just because you go to UT.  Engineering job recruiting is not easy and can often be overwhelming.  Social skills are just as important as GPA and many students who have great GPAs struggle in recruiting.

It is probably going to be around 40k more over the course of your four years. Will you get enough aid and if you do not can you afford to pay or take loans. And the second factor that goes along with it is what are you planning on majoring in? So look up if UT is good with game design and has a significantly better program at UT over UTD. If you want to do computer science then I would lean towards UT because it has one of the best com-sci programs. Finally, are you into being really social? This sounds weird but I am not that social but I have made a lot of good friends here and everyone here at UT is super friendly and you can literally make friends with anyone and I am having a great time at UT. Meanwhile, my friends at UTD said they barely have made any friends at UTD because a lot of people just don't talk there. So if you really want to have fun in college then for sure UT.  I would say choose UT if you get into the com-sci program (it is different than getting into UT)  and if you want to have a lot of ""social"" involved fun. If you are someone who doesn't want to party and wants to solely focus on school then UTD is a great option as it is really cheap. So it all really depends on what you want out of your college experience. I hope this helps  because I know I was struggling with this decision last year but I chose UT and I do not regret it at all.

7603,"First of all, I absolutely respect your desire to work with students. Have I tried to say anything differently? If a faculty member entered the profession organically with passion, then I absolutely desire that kind of instructor. Congratulations on coming to the profession the way that you did. I am obviously not talking about you. Also, no need to worry about this particular student. It took a few months but now I am currently employed at Amazon making an acceptable (though not great) salary as mobile developer. I am currently very happy with my situation for now.

Some professors at UT Austin are passionate about their job. I feel that just talking to you now you would be able to come up with multiple exams having different questions on each exam. That would have avoided this issue all together. Indeed, I encountered many professors who were able to accomplish just that. If cannot use the excuse that it is simply TOO HARD (oh and BTW I do NOT think that ""TOO HARD"" acceptable excuse for missing a question on an exam) to answer the questions then faculty should not be able to use when coming up with new questions. Again, if he had used exams with different questions on them for the different times than why would he care if students are going on GroupMe. This was far easy to avoid, to just simply allow it to happen in the first place. BTW I do agree that no matter what now the students who engaged in impropriety should be disciplined but the truth is that many faculty members at UT are far too quick to accuse people of cheating. One time in a Linear Algebra course taught by Alan K. Cline I had a printout of an old exam that he provided us on canvas that was reviewing in class moments before the exam. While he was passing out the exams, he told us to keep the exams face down until he told us to begin. So that is what I did, and I continued studying for the exam by going over the work I had done on the old exam before class. Meanwhile, while the professor passed out the exams to the rest of class, another student had come in and set beside me. When Professor Cline returned my section of the classroom, he saw me reviewing the old exam in my hands while the new exam was still face down. At this moment he got confused and accused me in front of the whole class of having begun the exam early. After handling him with kid gloves and gently explaining the situation, to a grown adult mind you, that I was merely reviewing an old exam for practice, he let the matter drop (though he never apologized). The lesson here is that faculty need to understand that cheating is VERY serious and making such allegations lightly is harmful to the academic process and future well-being of the person Falsely accused. What if America had more stringent anti-defamations laws? I am no lawyer but, I wonder if a professor who WRONGLY accused a student of academic misconduct could that professor be sued for causing economic harm to the student? This is not the case in America because apparently, professors are heavily protected by our first amendment, or at least that is what I have read online when others asked this question. My point is academic dishonesty is very serious and the implications are very serious (as anyone should be when a person is rightly accused). However, always assuming the worst of students is not a healthy atmosphere that is most conducive to learning. 
 
As far as being wronged by A single faculty or A single staff member I suppose that could be True. Many (though not ALL) of the faculty and staff that I encountered I felt could have performed their occupation far better (or at least have a better attitude) or somebody in the world could have done a far better job. Whenever, I watch a movie or tv show or think about politics or anything else I always think that if I (a person with absolutely NO experance in the field what so ever) could write a better script or make a better law or perform the task better than something is VERY wrong. Under no circumstances should person with no experience or training be able to perform any aspect of a job better than someone who is. If I write a program that some else could even though, they have no prior professional programing experience than I need to do a better job. That is simply unacceptable. I should NEVER be able to do task better than someone who is being paid a salary to perform that task. If feeling this way means I was ""wronged"" then that is what happened. It is the overall attitude of people who supposedly work 40 hours a week that are simply helpless when it comes to properly advising students. (e.g. “I advise thousands of students. You are not the only one.” Etc) If you feel that you are unable to perform the task required by the job than, maybe that job is not ideal for you and you should find other employment. I can only imagine the reaction if I told project manager that I simply overwhelmed and that I can perform the very job I agreed to do at hiring. In the real world outside of academia they just simply fire you when refuse or are unable to perform the job that were hired to do. Also, if we are going to be held responsible NO MATTER WHAT than why are we students paying higher tuition and employing someone that could be replaced by computer or software program. A software program (I could write a program atomically replies to all emails, “well that is your fault, you should be more reasonable.” Shit I probably could train a monkey to that) can perform all the functions that many of the advisors where doing (with respect to me at least), but it has the added benefit that it does require health insurance and retirement benefits nor can a software program be a victim or a perpetuator of sexual harassment. Less liability and lower cost for the same service. Seriously what is the justification for hiring a person when the job (as far as I can tell) could be replaced with a software program.

I realize that as a faculty member you feel obligated to defend your colleagues but sometimes that can bring you down with them. One day UT Austin will be investigated, and they will find gross incompetence and abuse of power at the university. I am not saying that EVERYBODY will be implicated but they will find plenty of abuse and they have already found corruption at the university (see Wallace Hall’s investigation of the law school in 2013 or the FBI investigation regarding the college admissions scandal).

I do not know your field or department, lukipedia, but as a computer science major I found that MOST of the advising staff were very arrogant and MANY (but not most in this case) of the faculty, acting like they did like that they reinvented the wheel or something. Maybe UT Austin faculty and staff need to take humility training or something because carrying themselves as if they have won Nobel Prizes when obviously they have not is simply embarrassing. Such humbleness would hopefully cause them to be more mindful of their actions. Remember I have actually BEEN an undergraduate student at the University of Texas at Austin. I know very well what it is like to experience the school in that way. The certain members routinely take for granted the very people in the school that provide a reason for its existence. Universities, like UT Austin, are not created for faculty and staff. They are created and continue to exist for the students and other than research their primary function today is to educate STUDENDTS. Indeed, you yourself just said you wanted to become a professor because you “enjoy working with students.” We are the purpose of the institution’s existence everything else is merely necessary to perform that end goal. If you so desire it and you think some billionaire will pay for it than, instead of polluting and corrupting our university maybe, you found your own institution that is only concerned with faculty and staff and does not have any students.

On the 2.4 GHz band, [there are only enough channels to run three non-interfering connections at a time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels#/media/File:NonOverlappingChannels2.4GHzWLAN-en.svg), so once you have more than three wifi networks at once on 2.4 GHz, they'll start stepping on each other.

The 5GHz band is much, much wider, with enough space for [something like 25 connections at once](https://www.maketecheasier.com/assets/uploads/2017/06/best-5ghz-channel-bands-diagram.jpg) (or 12 double-width, 40 MHz connections).

You totally shouldn’t take that to heart though. It’s just because of the massive initial experience gap and all it means is you have to work harder. But if you stick with it, by the time you’re an upperclassman, you’ll probably be better than a lot of those kids because you worked hard while they sat back relied on their prior experience. Of course if CS isn’t your thing then don’t feel obligated to push through it, but just because you’re struggling right now doesn’t mean CS isn’t your thing, it just means you have some catching up to do. So work hard, go to office hours, and be patient with yourself. You can do it! It sounds like you’re already on the right track.

If it makes you feel better, I started studying for this test 2 weeks ago and pulled 2 all nighters the days before and I STILL found it hard. I also didn’t even realize that we couldn’t use calculators and I only knew how to solve those short answer time questions with one. I admit, I left the test feeling defeated and questioning whether CS is for me. It’s not that everyone is super smart or anything, the people that have previous experience are sometimes just the loudest and want it to be known. I never coded in my life and 312 was my first ever programming class. Naturally, I felt intimidated by others because I started off “behind”.  314 is a difficult class and it’s absolutely going to take a lot of effort, but there are more people that feel the same way as you do than you think.

That said, I would indeed suggest that anybody accused of this fight the charges rather than just giving up.  Assuming that everybody who signed up for the chat cheated isn't likely to fly, especially with all the attention this has gotten.

(Also, I guess in the future ... people should sign up for these chats with an bogus name and email that can't be linked back to anything at UT?

Hook 'em Horns is the slogan and hand signal of The University of Texas at Austin. Students, alumni, and fans of the university employ a greeting consisting of the phrase ""Hook 'em"" or ""Hook 'em Horns"" and also use the phrase as a parting good-bye or as the closing line in a letter or story.

The gesture is meant to approximate the shape of the head and horns of the UT mascot, the Texas Longhorn Bevo. The sign is made by extending the index and pinky fingers while grasping the second and third fingers with the thumb.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_%27em_Horns 

Horns down has no such history. It’s purpose is solely to express disapproval of UT. No one argues that Aggies throwing up Gig’em, TCU’s Go Frogs, or Baylor’s Sic ‘Em are taunts during contests against UT (or otherwise) are taunting. Each one has a history and connection to their respective school and only is antagonistic to the extent that contest are zero-sum. My understanding is that OU has no such gesture of support to pair with Boomer Sooner etc., hence the resorting to horns down. It would be the same if UT fans resorted to thumbs down instead of hook em.",0.0643,0.5167,0.419

Some UT fans will see it as insulting, while non UT fans view it as a great way to root for their team against UT. That’s an expected back and forth between fans. And I think it’s ultimately more telling that a fan base can’t come up with a sign beyond flipping their rival’s upside down.

Second, that horns up is somehow taunting as well. This one isn’t really sound. You even draw the distinction: down is solely a negative reaction to UT whole up is a positive sign of support. People throw the horns up in all kinds of non competitive settings. Sure, in a game setting supporting one’s own team necessarily means rooting against the other.

8224,"&gt;Austin has a small population of ‘white squirrels,’ found mostly in and around the University of Texas campus and surrounding neighborhoods. Contrary to popular belief, these squirrels are not albinos, but rare color variations of the Eastern Fox Squirrel, with a naturally occurring condition called ‘leucism.’ Unlike albinism, this condition is caused by a reduction in all types of skin pigments, not just melanin. This is why these squirrels often appear pale yellow with normally colored eyes, instead of pure white with red eyes typical of an albino form.

8310,"Following the other comment in this thread, I will post my rental history.

Sophomore year - Vintage West Campus - $1500/month - 1x1 furnished - This place was honestly nice. It's tucked away in one of the quieter places near campus. Complex itself got loud at times but overall was pretty nice. It feels a little dated compared to a lot of places in West Campus, but feels significantly more modern compared to stuff you see in North campus and the like. You can probably find nicer places in West Campus if you are rooming with others though.

Junior year - Signature 1909 - $1200/month - 3x3 furnished - nice, but overpriced. Heard they, like many other big complexes, are slashing prices due to reduced demand, however. Depending on where you are in the complex, it does get very loud. Many a night I spent getting woken up by pool parties at 2am. Garage sucks ass. Furniture is ass, aside from the nice TVs. Overall, I think it was alright but definitely overpriced.

Currently - West Koenig Flats (north loop area) - $1500/month - 1x1 unfurnished - I've really been enjoying it here. The apartments are not well insulated from sounds, but other than that, everything else is super nice. It's not a very loud community regardless. No major complaints, and I plan to stay here for the foreseeable future. It'll be the first place I end up renewing at in Austin.

Edit: I guess I should add why I left the places I did. I left vintage because I wanted to see if I would like to room with others, so I roomed with 1 friend and 1 other guy who was put in our 3x3. That was the only reason I didn't stay at vintage. Signature just felt overpriced and by the end of last semester I was just done with West Campus in general, it doesn't fit my lifestyle (I'm a homebody and don't like to deal with the constant noise). So I looked at places in North campus, Hyde Park, north loop, and far west. I actually stayed in a place in far west for a month but it was infested with bugs and I got out of the lease and moved to West Koenig Flats. I really like the North Loop / North Campus area. Campus is still close, but it's a lot more chill than west campus. Feels safe. Not as many good food options, but there's a few gems out here. It's central enough that nothing feels too far away.",0.4085,0.3906,0.2009

8351,"I’ll give you my rental history for my time at UT because I think I got a good mix of places, but I wish I’d done things a bit differently. 

Year 1- Moorehill Dorm. Not what you’re asking about (tho I loved it there)

Year 2- Apartment on Nueces/21st. I paid $1,050 for a 1 bedroom with free parking and a small garden. You know those small, shitty looking apartment complexes you see in West Campus in between the huge new buildings? It was one of those. Unfortunately it got torn down to build one of those huge buildings instead :( Which sucked, i loved that place and it was super affordable. It was cute, 3 min walk to campus, bodega around the corner, and I never saw a bug (seriously, not ANY type of bug, and this was West Campus!). 

Year 3- 22nd and San Gabriel. I paid $1,300 for a one bedroom in another small shitty complex. Farther from campus. Across from a frat house that would blast music and leave their trash all over the alley. I paid way too much for this place tbh. 

Year 4- Red River &amp; 38th St. I paid $950 for a bedroom in a huge 2 story 3bed/2.5 bath house. Free parking, washer dryer, lots of windows. Living in North Campus was so nice after dealing with Wampus for years. Getting to campus wasn’t difficult because the 10 bus stopped near the house. I definitely recommend going for North Campus, and renting a house was nice because we had a lot more space BUT I will say when renting a house there may be more fees you have to pay for than an apartment (ex lawn, trash, gas, etc). We also had a very high electric bill ($300). 

If I had the option, I totally would have stayed in that tiny $1050 apartment. It was such a good value for the location. If not, I would move out to North Campus sooner and share a house again. Don’t pay $1300 for anything in West Campus. Not smart.

I study way more for my Biochem class where I try and review a week in advance for the exam than my elective classes where I literally start studying a day or two in advance for exams.

Best advice is to stop cramming for exams. Actually try to digest the information the 1st time and do spaced repetition (I use a program called Anki that's great for this). 

Actually sleep, you're not going to get anything productive done at 2am in the morning, and a lot of your information is actually retained and processed after a good night of sleep.

Rote memorization is abysmal when it comes to learning. At best, it will help your short-term memory or create a very short lived long-term memory. Instead, make learning more conceptual based.

&gt;Goodenough, who was born in 1922, identified and developed the critical materials that provided the high-energy density needed to power portable electronics, initiating the wireless revolution. Today, batteries incorporating Goodenough’s cathode materials are used worldwide for mobile phones, power tools, laptops, tablets and other wireless devices, as well as electric and hybrid vehicles.

&gt;“Billions of people around the world benefit every day from John’s innovations,” said Gregory L. Fenves, president of The University of Texas at Austin and former dean of the Cockrell School. “In addition to being a world-class inventor, he’s an outstanding teacher, mentor and researcher. We are grateful for John’s three decades of contributions to UT Austin’s mission.”  
&gt;  
&gt;**“Live to 97 (years old) and you can do anything,” said Goodenough. “I’m honored and humbled to win the Nobel prize. I thank all my friends for the support and assistance throughout my life.”**

#FAQ

#What does this mean?

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

#Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

•	⁠Rudeness towards other Redditors,
•	⁠Spreading incorrect information,
•	⁠Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.

#Am I banned from the Reddit?

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

#I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

#How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",0.0318,0.2783,0.69

Of course, it does nothing to move my argument forward. I wholeheartedly agree that with your statement there, because it wasn't meant to!

**Honestly, I think this entire chain of posts is built on a foundation of misunderstanding.**

Here's why I think we're misunderstanding each other, since it seems like your arguments are completely tangential to my assertions due to the assumptions we've built up about each other mutually.

For instance, I never once asserted that you meant allergies within your definition of being ill. In fact, I do the exact opposite, as I pointed out that this person could have had allergies. I then turn my attention to Sharpieman who responded to me about people with allergies. I don't doubt how annoying the person who is sneezing and coughing can be, but that's a disturbance to be expected within a given time in a given area in allergy season. You have an estimated 30 to 60 million people with these symptoms in the US alone, so think about the odds.

To explain, I think probabilistically. So, in my mental construct, these types of annoyances will happen at some point in time regardless of our desires. We have people of varying cultures and backgrounds with different values. Incompatibility in expected behavior will occur. The best way to deal with nuisances like this is to deal with it, ignore it, or maneuver around the problem. You unfortunately can't fix every problem. My suggestion is to simply confront the person or move elsewhere to study.

That was the crux of my opinion and suggested solution to this problem the person had. In fact, that was the crux of what Epictetus argued, since he argued in his very first point in his Enchiridion that you should not become enslaved to matters beyond your control. You appear to be taking what he said rigidly without understanding what he meant.

&gt;**If you need direct quotations by Epictetus himself, I recommend you read this:** *""When you set about any action, remind yourself of what nature the action is. If you are going to bathe, represent to yourself the incidents usual in the bath—some persons pouring out, others pushing in, others scolding, others pilfering. And thus you will more safely go about this action if you say to yourself, “I will now go to bathe and keep my own will in harmony with nature.” And so with regard to every other action. For thus, if any impediment arises in bathing, you will be able to say, “It was not only to bathe that I desired, but to keep my will in harmony with nature; and I shall not keep it thus if I am out of humor at things that happen.”*

People will sneeze, cough, and so on in copious amounts at times. That is what humans will occasionally do. Your claim that Stoicism deals strictly with only the issues you list is baseless.

Furthermore, you seem to have mistaken this following sentence as being directed towards you:  ""You really can't expect everyone with an allergy to avoid PCL."" I actually had the same issue with Sharpieman where he wrote, ""Also other people don't know, so you should at least separate yourself a bit from others out of courtesy, or tell people if you're going to sit next to them."" I stated my confusion afterwards for that explicit reason. Apparently, you thought I was being ""grumpy"". No, I wasn't sure who he was referring to. I explained why I responded the way I did to you. I'm not trying to bait you. I'm explaining what I meant by my post to you.

Also, ideally, yes, the library should be quiet, but you are liable to become disappointed if you think it will always be that way. Uncertainties are a part of life. The world does not revolve around oneself unfortunately, as much as we all innately wish it were so!

Lastly, I have no idea what you hoped to accomplish by bringing up my writing. I think I would be more worried about that move weakening your own ethos more than anything else. Honestly, if that was an attempt to hurt my ego, it didn't do the job. I'm not really worried about the quality of a half-assed post I've made on Reddit, and I'm surprised you have such high standards for Reddit!

Epictetus was indeed a fine philosopher. I am fan of his work. As one of the leading proponents of stoicism he suggested that we should focus on things within our span of control.  He thought that we shouldn’t worry about things like the possibility of sickness, or death, or an asteroid crashing down upon us.  But that’s not what this is about.  Your premises are flawed.  Your clever use of italics and appeal to others do nothing to move your argument forward.

My suggestion, friendly and straightforward, was to act on something entirely within my span of control.  To inform others who might not think about such things. To share resources that improve the public good.  

Your assume that by “sick,” I mistakenly include illness due to virus or bacteria, with  an inflammatory response due to a variety of air born particles. I do not. You would have had a fairer point had you pointed out the unclear nature of the term “sick.” You did not.

You purpose that it is unreasonable to think that a library, in a designated quiet study area, would actually be quiet. I think the error of this argument need not be made explicit.

I, too, pay an unfortunate sum to live in a quiet place. However, I do that so I can relax and get much needed rest. Studies have shown that  class preparation, homework, and the like are best performed in places like libraries, much in the same vein as going to the office to work. Home study is less effective because of all the nice, fun, and relaxing things available to us there. I’d cite these studies but I’d rather to get back to watching Peaky Blinders. It’s a fine form of escapism.

Lastly, I suggest you pay attention to grammar and spelling. Flaws in these areas affect the ethos of your argument resulting  in damage to your reputation in the eyes of the audience, making an already weak argument weaker.

8752,"This really just depends on a lot of factors. My first piece of advice is to simply take out the maximum amount of loans that you can if you haven't already. Getting out of school without debt sounds great, but working 30 hours on top of a 12 credit hours schedule sounds like a particularly sweltering corner of hell depending on the classes you're taking.

EDIT: To add onto this, finaid should be getting better for transfers starting next year, so if you had to increase your stafford loans it might just be for this year:  [https://texasadvance.utexas.edu/](https://texasadvance.utexas.edu/) 

Now if you're financial aid dependent then theres a good chance that you've taken the minimum number of hours needed to max out your Pell Grant, so you can't really change your schedule. One suggestion is to Pass/Fail one of your more minor courses. It will morph into an elective which doesnt count for a degree requirement, but it may take the pressure off so you can focus on other classes. Right now you need to figure out what is absolutely essential and everything else needs to be downsized.

I also wouldnt start questioning your CS skills until you're in a more comfortable position. No one can perform when anxious and tired.

When it comes to how you feel, I have a bit more context. I'm also a transfer student, first semester here, and things are pretty tough. All of my time has been taken up by the workload that I thought would be oh so managable. What I would keep in mind is that nearly everyone goes through this, and this isnt just something you should brush aside and think ""that just happens to other people."" . If there's a tendency to get sad during the first semester, then expect to get sad, if people get anxious, expect to get anxious.

Assume that you are every bit as vulnerable as those who came before and learn from their example. Don't just try to bulldoze your way through the emotions of the beginning of this new chapter and accept that you're not the iron giant. I would also speak to your professors and describe what you're going through. Because of the hoops transfers have to go through to get here, we tend to feel like if we are doing anything other than simply performing and smiling and yelling ""Hook Em!"", then the school will just reject us like an immune system fighting off foreign DNA.

This isn't True, most everybody in the faculty wants you to succeed and they will go to surprising lengths to help you do this. Work hard and show that you're really making an effort, but also come to office hours and describe your difficulties. If nothing else, you will have said your peace.

&gt;white people are obviously wrong  
&gt;  
&gt;colored people are very careful about not invading people's personal spaces, and apologize when they unintentionally do so

&gt;white people constantly keep bumping into them during class and they don't give two shits about what happened

that's **definitely** stereotyping. I'd love to hear your explanation as to how it isn't.

You clearly do not know anything about how white people constantly violate the personal space of others and get away with it, clearly because no one has told you about it.

Of course, white people may do this unintentionally, however it still counts as white privilege and racism.

Of course what I've written here is absolutely nothing compared to the civil rights movement, however both of them have something in common - calling out the superior group for their racist behaviour. You obviously cannot digest the fact that I've called out your race, and have not remained quiet like the other POCs (whose voices are stifled due to such comments that people like you make), which is why you call me a moron, or a twat, or whatever, just so that you can defeat me and put me down, and ask me to delete my post, despite the fact that I am also entitled to an opinion like you are.

I guess since the POC had her space invaded by a white guy it automatically becomes a race issue, right?

So I cannot ask for personal space from a white guy who is doing me a favor? Is personal space a PRIVILEGE? 

It doesn't even look like as of you've read my post. Whatever I've written here, is obviously nothing compared to the civil rights movement. However, IF you can read between the lines, you will understand that the civil rights movement and my post have something in common - calling the superior group out on their controlling behaviour. 

Yes, this is a racial issue. BECAUSE most POCs I know have made the same statements - I am not stereotyping anyone based on one incident. As a white person, you may be oblivious about it. However that does not change the fact that this is a racial issue, and that white people are obviously wrong.

8766,"&gt;He was sitting there first. Just because you need that spot doesn’t give you any right to it over him. 

I never said that anyone had more preference - this is just a plain problem of personal space. Yes, he did come before me, and I did ask him politely about whether I could sit there. However, you absolutely have no excuse for violating anyone's personal space intentionally. Yes, the guy did come first, but his name was not engraved in the table. Even if I was sitting in the guy's apartment, this guy has no reason to violate my personal space at all. He doesn't have any right to violate my personal space ever since he came first. I really love the excuses that white people give to justify instances of racism that occur - is asking for personal space a PRIVILEGE? 

&gt;Are white people checking what race the person sitting across from them are and then deciding if they’re gonna invade their personal space or not? No. 

When did I say that anyone does that? I've only said, that most POCs have noticed this general trend of white people not respecting other people's spaces. You are trying to frame me as being racist and making stereotypes about white people, just because you are triggered that someone has called out white people over their superiority on campus. 

&gt;This isn’t a race issue. You’re making actual race issues look smaller because you want to bring race into this. Stop being the boy who cried wolf.

Ofc this is. If people from several minority communities on campus have noticed this kind of behaviour, it IS a racial problem. It is a problem of white superiority. I'm not making racial issues on campus any smaller, because people like you stifle the voices of the minorities once such behaviour is called out. In fact, are such incidents even talked about in the first place, other than in liberal arts classes? Nope.

I've lived in this city all of a month, I didnt realize that consecutive failures in the bus route could occur. My previous commute was an hour and a half. I never missed a test, and that's because I was familiar with the traffic and could plan accordingly.

No one here is arguing whether or not it's a students responsibility to get to school. It always is, even if their car breaks down or other extenuating circumstances occur. This I'd why we have systems in place to determine the degree of fault. Technically there's always a way to get to school, but many schools will take a mechanics receipt as proof enough for a makeup even though they arguably could have taken an Uber.

All I asked was who I could talk to to see if the circumstances were mitigating enough to warrant a makeup. I've talked to them, and though I don't yet have a makeup, if this were a UT shuttle I already would.

You can read more about that here: https://sites.utexas.edu/tobaccofree/faq-2/. That being said, knowing that the ban is more of a formality, the campus police don't enforce it (or anyone for that matter).

I see people vaping on campus at least 4 or 5 times a week. I haven't seen anyone do it during a class or indoors, but I see it on Speedway and other outdoor areas all the time.

I don't really care about reporting people because 1) it's a waste of my time, 2) I would have to file a report at least once a day, and 3) it doesn't bother me when people vape around me.",0.032,0.2678,0.7002

8796,"I agree with you, but let's not be so harsh and turn this into a mob. The blame does not rest squarely on OP here.

I'm all about personal responsibility and chewing folks out for absconding from what they ought to be doing, but OP isn't entirely wrong. A bus being late by thirty-five minutes is bad even by Cap Metro standards. Let's have some nuance here.

I think it's impractical to assume personal responsibility every single time when we live in a society that prioritizes reliance and dependence on others. With that said, OP needs to understand the system fails at times, and we should have a cushion in place to mitigate the risk. It's not like he was being irresponsible, rather he didn't anticipate that the system in place will fail from time to time. You cannot anticipate the unknown unknowns.

With that said, if he doesn't account for this next time, then he's being irresponsible now that he's aware of the risk.

So yeah, OP, regardless of the outcome, arrive earlier if you can from now on. Not everyone is forgiving when it comes to being late. Essentially, avoid leaving things up to chance now that you know that buses cannot be depended upon to arrive on time all the time. These things, as unfortunate as they are, happen in life, and you need to be prepared for it. So, don't ignore what these guys are saying.

I've already been told that if this was a UT shuttle that was late, I would definitely get a make up because they can verify that the bus came late.

The bus took longer on the route due to each stop becoming full of people who missed the two previous buses. More stops + more people = more time.

If she doesnt catch it i’ll just go on not knowing i still have to satisfy that flag so. For your case, I’d look up the head of the department or a higher rank assistant maybe?

But I promise it gets better! Go to the SI sections, go to lab hours. And please make sure for those tests you are practicing with Mike's old exams online! I spent the whole week in advance studying those exams and seeing what mistakes I need to avoid. The great thing about his exams is that there is a pattern in the test set-up, and you will definitely see similarities between your exam and the coding problems on past exams. If you have trouble with a past exam, a TA at lab hours can help you through it.

I don't think most people did well on this first exam because no one knew how to study for this stuff. Just make sure to take advantage of these resources. If you still decide that you don't want to continue with CS, there is zero shame in that. It must be hard having to deal with a demanding major and real-world adult problems.

First, take a couple of days for yourself. If you need to catch up on sleep, do it. If you just need to take some time for mental health, do that too. School will still be waiting for you in a couple of days when you're in a better mindset.

I know UT Austin can feel a bit big, isolating, and overwhelming at times. The courses definitely demand a lot from you and leave little time for much else. I work a VERY part-time job and even that can be overwhelming at times when I'm taking classes.

If at all possible, I would recommend trying to work less hours and go into office hours regularly. On of the biggest things I think that helps my grades is going once a week to an office hour for my toughest class(es). It's for sure a time commitment, but even if you don't have questions it can be helpful to hear what other students need help on. If you are alone with the professor, voice your concerns. I think more than anything your teachers just want to know you are/are making an effort. They can often give out pretty good advice. 

If you are having trouble making connections, try to go to community events posted by UT Events or join an organization. I find that most people here really don't care about your age (and often find ""older"" kids to be cooler anyhow), so don't be afraid to say hi to people. 

Finally, remember that you DO belong here. One rough semester does not mean that they will all be this hard. Transitional periods are rocky for us all. Just ask any ""traditional"" student about their experience first semester freshman year.",0.4548,0.4403,0.1049

[Be sure to remember this](https://twitter.com/uttowertweets/status/1050152013395312641).

Just because you didn’t get in at first doesn’t mean anything. There are a whole lot of people who got in at first and then failed out.. so when you came here has nothing to do with anything.

You’re just scared and you’re panicking. 

However, you might want to consider changing majors if this isn’t your passion.

But..

Get off Netflix. Spend your time in the PCL vs studying alone in your room/dorm. 

You may be putting in the hours... but if you’re also texting and checking Instagram when you’re supposed to be studying... you’re shouting yourself in the foot.

Relax. Take a deep breath.. and put in the work. 

What you’re going through is pretty typical. 

Everyone’s playing it off like they have everything under control.

No, you’re not the only one who is having a bumpy start. 

You failed one exam... that doesn’t mean you’re not cut out for college. 

Here’s my opinion on what to do:

1. Study in the PCL

2. Never skip a class

3. Always go to professor office hours every week

4. Admit you need help. Go to your professor and say exactly what you’re talking about in this post - I promise you they’ll help you with what you’re going through and will work with you. Just show you care.

5. Stop going out partying on Thursdays 

6. Turn your phone off when you’re in class and don’t be on Facebook when you’re in class.

7. I see in your post history you play League Of Legends so I’d assume you’re a gamer. Cut the games out. You failed an exam... you don’t have the luxury of being able to spend time playing video games. 

8. Exercise regularly. 3-4 times a week at least. You’re going to implode with stress if you don’t do this.

9. YouTube is your friend. Go experts teaching the classes you’re taking on YT and take advantage of it. MIT open courses, Khan Academy, etc. are all great starting places. 

These are just my recommendations.. It doesn’t mean I’m right. 

However, what you’re doing isn’t working. They say the definition of insanity is repeating the same thing over and over and expecting different results.

What you’re doing isn’t working. Listen to my advice if you want to... but I’d you keep doing what you’re doing:

You will almost certainly fail.

You’re smart. You can do this. We’re rooting for ya.

Feel free to message me if you’re needing to talk to someone.

Best of luck.

8979,"It sounds a lot like you’re dealing with imposter syndrome. I also suffered from imposter syndrome during my first year in UTCS. I had never programmed before and I underestimated the workload. I didn’t even make the gpa cutoff and had to petition to stay in the program. With that said, getting through the degree after a rough first year is very doable. For the imposter syndrome I recommend making a list of accomplishments to help remind you that you are worthy of being at UT. For starters, you got in to UTCS as a transfer which is increasingly difficult every year. Admissions didn’t make a mistake, you deserve to be here. Coming back to school after a gap also takes a good amount of determination so there’s also that. 

I can’t imaging having to deal with this on top of a job. Someone else mentioned taking out loans. While not ideal, I also recommend this so you can reduce time working to give you a better chance of improving your grades. UT has a really great CS program and their tech companies partners know that. They recruit heavily based on school reputation so with a degree it’s very likely you’ll have a good job when you graduate. If you do decent enough in 314 then you already know enough to land an internship. One summer alone could pay tuition for a year if you’re on in state tuition. 

For community and support, you can also join some of the student orgs in UTCS. The people in the orgs are very welcoming and I relied heavily on help from people I met in orgs. The company events hosted by student orgs is also how I got my job. You get more personal time with recruiters there than at career fair. I know ACM has been trying to do more to reach out to students in the intro courses with helpful events like CS 101 workshops. ABCS and HACS also host study nights for the intro classes that are open to anyone. I know somewhere on campus there’s a student org for non-traditional students in all majors as well. 

I’ve already graduated and moved away but feel free to message me if you need any other advice.",0.6311,0.3203,0.0486
8980,"Hey, sorry you're having a tough time. FWIW, as others have mentioned, tons of people have a difficult first semester or even year - ESPECIALLY in engineering degrees. UT's CS program is often ranked in the top 10 in the country though, so you're definitely working for something that's valuable.

I agree with what others have said that it would be great to try to finish your first year if at all possible. Take a class pass/fail if you have to and that's an option that works with your financial aid.

One of the great things about being a CS major is you have the opportunity to get paid internships over the summers, even after just your first year of school (though they are harder to come by after only 1 year). Keep going with CS now, and in the Spring go to the CS career fair with 50 resumes. Hand them out to everyone, try to get as many interviews as you can, and try to score a summer internship. The pay at the internships I'd estimate would be 2-3x what you're making as a clerk, so 3 months of summer internship could buy you 6-9 months of not having to work as a clerk. 9 months would get you through an entire school year! (With this math, you might run out right at the end of the school year...just in time to start another summer internship and repeat the process...)

One final thought - you may have heard some people talking about ""how easy"" they've found the CS classes, but that's just classic selection bias. People who are having a harder time with things aren't as loud about it as people who aren't. I *guarantee* you there are more people struggling and having a tough time with the intro classes than people who are breezing through them. So you're not alone, and don't take it to mean you ""don't belong"".

Good luck! You got this :)",0.7217,0.2332,0.0451
8981,"To be fair, they're majoring in computer science, so once they graduate they will have solid job prospects even right out of college, and can be making enough money to pay down student loans even somewhat comfortably. Possibly the loans would even turn out a net positive financial investment (in addition to helping them keep their sanity) by letting them make better grades, helping them get a better, higher paying job once they graduate.

For sure the biggest issue with this is the risk that they take out the loans and then quit CS without the degree or even after getting the degree but before working for a few years to pay off the loans.

8987,"If there is, I havent found it. If you're low income you're relying on grants, scholarships, and loans and if he had enough funds my guess is he wouldnt be working 30 hours a week. He could apply for scholarships, but that includes writing essays which doesnt seem like something he has time to do. Getting grants out of UT is at best extremely difficult, at worst impossible, and can altogether be just as time consuming a process as getting scholarships.

The basic idea is to replace the funds he's getting from his 30 hour job and separate it into loan funds and work study which is fairly easy to get if you give finaid a call. The increase might be roughly \~ 4,000$ - 5000$ per year, which is only slightly more than having to stay at UT another year, something that often happens to transfers juggling work and school, and far less than having to extend the stay by two or more years.

Just to clarify, when I mean take the ""maximum amount"" I'm talking about the max amount in federal stafford loans that you automatically apply for on the FAFSA. I'm not saying go private, which is a nightmare.

I spent the whole week in advance studying those exams and seeing what mistakes I need to avoid. The great thing about his exams is that there is a pattern in the test set-up, and you will definitely see similarities between your exam and the coding problems on past exams. If you have trouble with a past exam, a TA at lab hours can help you through it.

I agree definitely get help from office hour.

These resources are all too difficult to reach while working 30 hours a week.

I definitely do think this is a matter of white privilege. Most POCs I know have complained about this. I clearly have stated the reason as to why this is a racial issue throughout the thread, as well as my original post: white people may do this unintentionally, but when they do so, they don't apologize and they continue to do so, while POCs are very careful and insecure about violating other people's personal spaces. This makes POCs look like the ""personal space invaders"" since they are the ones who apologize, while white people do this more often than POCs, and just get away with it. 

Ofcourse, if you're white, then a POC won't complain about it to you if you ask him, right? Because the cultural differences are so big, that the voices of POCs are stifled when they point out racial issues that occur on campus.",0.0176,0.25,0.7324

For any student looking to become a software engineer 312 is your ticket and taking it sooner than later is really advantageous. That being said 319k has quite a large workload, I spent almost no time on 312 attempting to master the material. I'd say if you have at least 1 year of solid programming experience leading up to this then do it. If 312 and 319k are like the first time you have ever taken a programming class then there is no disadvantage in taking your time and mastering both, which will make you a stronger student/ future worker. If you do decide to take both, here is my advice: 319k will be an easy A compared to the programming in 312, just do all the labs ahead of time. Take 312 seriously, it may seem easy at first but the grading is in the details and just ""getting it"" will not get you an A, you'll have to spend more time building a really strong understanding.

A couple of things may be going on. It is possible that the course doesn't have an instructor yet and/or is in the process of being canceled.

If there are multiple sections of a course, and some are full, it is possible that the closed section is being held to see if more seats are needed, and if so (and if they have an instructor) it may be opened later.

9364,"I didn’t live on the Block on 25th specifically, but I lived on the Block on Rio. 

My apartment was extremely dirty upon move in. My shower was moldy. The counters were grimy. I walked around barefoot and my whole foot was covered in dirt. 

Now, fast forward to winter break. I came back home to my apartment with 6. Dead. Roaches. On the floor. With one of them still alive on its back and twitching for dear life. Don’t get me started on the smell and how I had to clean all of that up because I was the first one back home before my roommates. :) 

Utilities were also extremely high at my apartment and we couldn’t figure out why. We kept the A/C at a reasonable temperature during the summer and winter. (75 degrees really). Simple bills was just the worst, in my opinion.

Then there’s just typical west campus shenanigans. Loud parties, some inconsiderate neighbors, but that’s to be expected.

If you are having problems in more than just this class, then you should also speak to one of your academic advisors. They can help you assess your situation and get you plugged into the right resources to get on track.

If this is just a one class issue, some people will tell you just to Q drop the class. That is reasonable advice if, given your grade, you can’t score high enough to avoid retaking the class. If you can still score high enough to avoid retaking the class but you’ll end up with a less than stellar grade, you need to do the math before taking the Q drop. Sit down and calculate how much your final GPA will change without the Q drop. For example, if you get, a C versus retaking the class and getting an A in a 3 hour class, you’ll see that the overall impact on your GPA at graduation is very small. Some students have a tendency to try to over manage their GPAs and end up needlessly retaking classes.",0.1158,0.5496,0.3346

The thing about BIO 315H is that it’s actually the class where you learn genetics in the two part sequence, while BIO 325H is where they cover some genetics but also ecology, physiology, immunology, etc (so closer to what you would learn in the 311 sequence)

My point here is that if you go from BIO 315H to BIO 325 you will be learning much of the same stuff again. So it’s up to you whether you want that or not.

Personally I thought BIO 315H and 325H were approximately the same difficulty.

Take a look at [this zoning map for austin](https://maps-austin.com/img/0/austin-zoning-map.jpg). The yellow regions are zoned for single family homes. It is **illegal** to build any kind of dense affordable housing in those areas. Rich homeowners want to keep it that way because they have a vested interest in seeing their property values rise (look up ""Nimbyism""). If you are wondering why rent keeps getting more expensive in cities across America, it's because it is indirectly **mandated** by moronic zoning laws. [Here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pq-UvE1j1Q) that touches on this issue.       

[Here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExgxwKnH8y4) showing San Francisco as a case study of just how stupid zoning laws can get. Keep in mind, large swaths of San Francisco are zoned for single family homes, despite a huge housing shortage.     

As recently as 2004, West Campus was zoned in such a way that severely limited new apartment construction. It also limited, and continues to limit, build height which hurts the ability to distribute the cost of the land over more units. [Here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3zSOW_q4oE) that talks about West campus zoning.

The planned redevelopment of Riverside is just another example of luxury developers being the only ones who can afford to jump through hoops to get their projects built. Small time developers are at a huge systemic disadvantage (as shown in the San Francisco video). If we want Austin to be affordable, we have to stand up to rich homeowners who are pushing the car-centric, sprawled out, expensive future. We have to let small time developers build high density housing to keep up with demand.",0.0446,0.2984,0.657

9620,"Definitely resonated with that last part. There are so many opportunities to meet people here that it can almost feel overwhelming. And because there are so many small groups of people, it can be hard meeting new people since people tend to reserve themselves to their cliques once they find one.

The thing is you just never really know what group of people you really will vibe with. I’ve personally tried my hand at several clubs here and while I definitely have a made plenty of acquaintances at UT so far it’s hard for me to say I’ve really made many *good* friends so far, and I think it’s because of the micro diversity of cliques here at UT. 

I also think you should have mentioned the Greek life here... Greek life is huuuuuuuge at UT and if there’s something social going on an UT (assuming it’s not someone’s birthday) it’s a fraternity throwing a party or mixer 90% of the time. So while you have 60k students clawing and competing with each other to prove they’re worth talking to, you also have a pretty large number of people in frats/sororities that will almost exclusively talk/socialize only to people in their respective frat/sorority, which makes it even harder for people like me who prefer meeting people naturally to find genuine social interactions and events without over-exerting yourself and feeling like you have to be apart of a group.

And I’m sorry for ranting a bit here but I also just want to mention that at least for me, I have never really tried making friends at any point in my life, which might sound weird, but hear me out. All the friendships I’ve made just happened naturally without me ever having to make a conscious effort. So now that I’ve been in college for a year, I’ve realized that you can’t just do that. You can’t just do what you like doing and expect to make friends naturally. That worked in high school and middle school when everyone had plenty of time and similar schedules, but in college, it’s every man for himself and more often than not, any two average students just won’t have the time or the energy during the week to make plans to meet and get together, and this is especially True for a big, spread out school like UT.",0.2101,0.5124,0.2775

The professor needs to do a bunch of paper work for each student, which is a lot of tedious workload. If a professor catches cheaters every semester, UT administration may think that professor does not emphasis academic integrity, but however he emphasizes it, people would still cheat in various ways.

That said, the first exam was INCREDIBLY difficult in my opinion.

He is being pretty understanding and planning to curve our exam as well as our final course grade, so we’ll see how that goes.

My main issue with the class (which may or may not be fair) is that it sort of caters to people on the IB track. He will often rush through a topic or a concept with the assumption that we all saw it in our internships, which is something I sort of wish he didn’t do.

9855,"&gt; If I have zero knowledge of CS before enrolling, will I be able to learn as I go or am I expected to know some stuff?

The curriculum is designed to start you from scratch (AP CS = CS312 Intro to Programming, pretty much. You can credit out if you want.)

&gt; Just generally, is it possible to maintain good grades and a good social life?

In general, if you do your due diligence, yes.

&gt; What are the different classes like?

Pretty diverse. There's a lot more theory than you might expect (a number of classes are taken entirely without touching a computer). Which is a good thing, since theory is what separates the *scientists* from the programmers (even though I'm terrible at theory...).

&gt; How are classes graded?

Tests usually have very high weight compared to homework, some classes emphasize their programming homeworks more heavily though. Expect things to be harder overall than APCS.

&gt; Group Projects?

Depends on the class. I don't think I've ever had a class where the partners were assigned, though.

&gt; Finally, what do you wish you had done/learned before college that would have helped you in UTCS?

Personally, getting my theory skills into better shape. Learning the fundamentals of proving stuff mathematically. I was weak on this going into the 2nd-semester theory class and lost motivation, which has hurt my theory development since. To be honest, you don't need *that* much theory in the real world, but I still think it's very useful to be good at it. Everything else I was able to pick up as I went.

No questions asked.
2. Mike Scott for data structures. You may have experience programming before, but this class really nails the concepts and problem solving into your head. He is an excellent lecturer and his tests are wonderful.
3. There is a respect for engineering here that is great. Ivies typically have bad CS programs, even though they are insanely elite, partially because the culture doesn't respect engineering. There was a guy who posted on r/ApplyingToCollege who was deciding between Harvard and here to study CS, and he ended up going with Harvard and (apparently) regretting it. You will find a lot of people here who don't just want to go into management, and really enjoy building things. I love that.
4. Austin isn't the bay area, but it's a very decent tech city full of engineers. Finding work after graduating really isn't a problem for CS students. I think we have like a 92% job placement rate on graduation day, I read that in a pamphlet somewhere but don't have the source.

Other than that, that's about it. You will have some shitty professors and some good ones, and the lab is full a lot.

For reference:
CS312 = Intro to Programming
CS314 = Data Structures
CS311 = Discrete Mathematics
CS331 = Algorithms
CS429 = Computer Architecture
CS439 = Operating Systems

I don't know the exact number for the graduation/pass rate but based off of the grade averages on things such as tests and assignments, I'd imagine that the majority of students graduate and pass. It's also fine if you don't have any knowledge of CS, as Mike Scott teaches CS312 under that assumption (I could be wrong, I skipped CS312 by using APCS credit). If you do have APCS credit, I recommend using it to go straight into CS314 as I thought I was adequately prepared and would have probably been bored in CS312.

The required classes you have to take include CS312, CS314, CS429, CS439, CS311, and CS331. CS312 and CS314 are in Java, with CS312 being essentially APCS and CS314 is your data structures class. In all of these required classes, the majority of your grade comes from the tests. Most of the learning happens in the assignments (whether it's programming or written), but the tests are evaluated very heavily when it comes to your final grade. For classes with pair programming assignments such as CS314 and CS439, you can choose your own partners.

He also seems to follow the textbook (will even write chapter names at the beginning of lecture) which is nice to know what’s on the test or clarify a confusing lecture.

10023,"Hi, I used to work in the admissions department at another university and also used to work reviewing scholarship applications for a nonprofit organization (am a graduate student now right now). 

I don't know where you stand exactly academically, but one of the biggest things you can do is make sure that you finish strong if you think you may be competitive for any academic scholarships. Especially going into your senior year, it is important that your transcript shows that you are taking a challenging course load.

Like the other commenter mentioned, just apply to as many as possible. It can be daunting because there are so many, but it really can be worth it. Start early, set yourself an application schedule, and get a parent or friend to help keep you accountable to turning in as many applications as possible. Also, don't just apply for the largest and most competitive scholarships. Some students have much more success applying to a large volume of smaller and local scholarships. Try asking a counselor or someone similiar at your school if they have a directory of local scholarships.

Almost every scholarship will require an essay portion, which is your chance to stand out. Ask a trusted teacher to revise and edit any essays that you write. (If you remember a year from now, feel free to dm me and I'd be happy to help as well). When I was rating scholarship applicants, the essay usually was the deciding factor, as it is usually hard to distinguish between otherwise equally excellent students.",0.4558,0.4777,0.0665

He also goes over the same lecture twice in one sitting so you understand the topics better.  Also the clicker questions that he uses in class sometimes end up getting into the tests, so pay attention.
At the end of the semester my whole group felt that they had learnt more from English than from any other professor. He actually cares about you understanding the topics, although it may not seem like that from RMP.
In general, BIO311D requires a lot of attention and English's class a bit more so, but the payoff is worth it.

A lot of people in the GroupMe complain about how hard it is, but I have always disagreed. It's not a complete joke, but putting in the bare minimum is enough to achieve an A.

The class involves two modules and associated readings per week, plus two extremely short (250 words) opinion essays (no outside research required). There are also biweekly modules on current events. Lastly there are 3 tests.

Honestly, I have just been doing the readings and watching the lectures (and paying attention). I got an A on the first test. I haven't taken any notes. The group review docs and PowerPoints are good enough notes to review before the test. So I spend maybe 2-3 hours a week on the class. It's really not bad.

Actually doing the readings is also important - people who try to skip or skim them seemed to do worse on the test (they ask content questions about every reading on the exam, so you need to know them). The readings aren't that long, just get through them. Some of them are interesting reads.

However, there are people that were in my cohort that looked for a job much longer than that. The program is a good way to get your foot in the door, it does a good job of networking/getting you in touch with the right people. I guess it just depends on if your putting your right foot forward and doing your due diligence in preparation for interviews. I will say though, having some computer science experience helps in finding a job. 

I did this program right after I graduated from UT so I was already living there. Didn’t have to worry about that part. A lot of people from my cohort found a sublease in west campus for the duration of the program and walked to campus. You could probably do Uber/Postmates/Lyft on the weekends but it’d be difficult on the weekdays. You’re on campus from 9am-5pm every weekday so it can get tiring. And you’ll have tests to study for and projects to work on top of that. They do have a scholarship that’ll pay for part of the tuition so I recommend doing that. They’ll also work with you figuring out a payment plan if u can’t pay for all of it at once. 

I know some people that have gotten great jobs from this program and some people that haven’t. Like I said I think it just depends on your networking as well as putting your best foot forward.

1. Price—it’ll be at least $1300 per month, add on an extra $100 if you want a parking spot, and another $100 if you take the larger bedroom. My tuition is free, so it isn’t as much as an issue for me, but if you need to save money, it might not be the best decision.

The Chicxulub crater (; Mayan: [tʃʼikʃuluɓ]) is an impact crater buried underneath the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. Its center is located near the town of Chicxulub, after which the crater is named. It was formed by a large asteroid or comet about 11 to 81 kilometres (6.8 to 50.3 miles) in diameter, the Chicxulub impactor, striking the Earth. The date of the impact coincides precisely with the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (K–Pg boundary), slightly less than 66 million years ago, and a widely accepted theory is that worldwide climate disruption from the event was the cause of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, a mass extinction in which 75% of plant and animal species on Earth became extinct, including all non-avian dinosaurs.

She left after the first half (thank goodness), but the damage was already done. I have asthma, but it's very light. Usually I have to have a pretty bad respiratory infection for it to get triggered. But this vaping set it off and hurt me to an extreme that I haven't felt before. It damaged my lungs, and it hurt to breathe for the next 3 days. I could barely go outside because breathing in anything that wasn't pure air (other vapors, cigarette smoke, even exhaust from cars) was really painful. I continuously had to use my inhaler throughout those three days, something that I hardly ever have to do.

For example, the 329E class sorta had to throw a git tutorial at you and then forced you to pick up unit testing/GitLab during the first project, which was also a Python programming project. Apparently in 330E, there's a larger emphasis on build systems and testing, and the first project is specifically designed to get you used to working with git/testing frameworks. I imagine this makes it a lot easier to learn it properly.

The overall impression I got is that CS329E was a ""learn to deploy a website in Python"" course. Now, it seems like CS330E is ""learn the tools you need (testing, Python, webtech, git) to properly manage a website"" and CS331E is ""apply these tools to actually deploy a well-managed website"" course.",0.5497,0.3933,0.057

Biggest complaint I’ve had is the first test was too long and we were not given enough time. Also, I wished she had not put a coding question so early on when we had only done one coding exercise.

Would you work low wage jobs the rest of your life struggling to make ends meet? Have a lifelong regret of not sticking with school? Feel anguish of not being able to give your family what they deserve? It will be unique to you what you want to work to avoid. Then do the same thing but imagine where you could be in 5 years if you do everything right. If you managed time well and gave up indulgences(but not all of them mind you, we all need to relieve stress and care for ourselves from time to time) where could you be if you did everything you needed to? Perhaps making 6 figures in 4 years or less and traveling the world on vacations? Living in a nice house and starting a family?

Make it a goal you can reach in under 5 years though. This heaven and hell, something to run towards and simultaneously something you are running from will help you clear focus on your path.

10703,"I actually do live on the Block on 28th right now and overall the experience is great and I cannot argue with the price. I'll list out some pros and cons.

Pros:

\-An easy walk from UT, less than a mile.

\-The rooms are pretty spacious and the stainless steel appliances are nice.

\-Some apartments are furnished and double occupancy furnished rooms have a cool divider in the middle for some privacy (I live in a double occupancy bedroom).

\-The water and electricity bill is pretty easy to manage. Me and my 3 roommates average $15 dollars a month per person which covers all utilities.

\-Any maintenance requests we have made were fixed in a day.

\-The Price. It's really low compared to the rest of west campus.

\-There is actually an Amazon delivery hub locker in the foyer of the apartment.

\-You can visit any of the other Block Properties with your fob and attend American Campus Community Events

\-You can access a pool and gym but those are offsite at a different property a few blocks down.

\-The internet is really fast

\-There is an onsite parking garage if you want to pay for parking.

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:

\-One of the elevators is pretty old and honestly doesn't feel nice to be on.

\-There are sometimes renovations done in the student lounge area so it can become inaccessible for a while.

\-There is a fraternity across the street that sometimes plays loud music on weekend afternoons that you can hear if you have a unit facing that side (It's not too bad though as they never play into the evening or night).

\-The presentation of the apartment building is kind of lackluster. Like there aren't like any cool lobby areas in the front. Just looks pretty basic in the foyer and hallways compared to other apartment buildings.

10704,"Hey I’m a transfer student also and can understand your situation. My commute is also almost an hour long and I have failed two midterms so far. UT is a much different environment and takes some time to get used to. I think it’s important to realize that it’s an adjustment period for transfers and we are all struggling together. I know for me it has helped to talk to other people in my classes who are in a similar boat as I am and studying on campus. I’ve noticed with being a commuter student it tends to feel like we’re not a part of the campus, but when I make the effort to go to campus to study or eat in the dining hall then I feel more connected with my classmates. My advice would be to take the time you need to improve your mental health, check out making an appointment with a non-academic counselor ( you can make the appointment online &amp; it’s an easy process), talk to someone from back home, and remember that this semester is only one semester at UT and it will not define how well you will do in future semesters.

For this year because you are new to the university staying you could try staying on campus for next semester, then then when you fully  adapt to the campus lifestyle, see if you want to go back to the commuting life or go hunting for a cheaper stay.

For academics, I would advise the Sanger Learning Center as well as office hours for professors. I failed a midterm too but hopefully if you change your study strategy a bit youll do better (at least I did). 

As for mental health, you could contact a non academic advisor, or the mental health clinic from the university health services building. I read you did that so my next advise would be talk to someone really close to you like a family member or friend and tell them that you had suicidal thoughts.

He is actually a Physics professor at Texas State and he does night classes from 5pm to 9pm slot at ACC Riverside a few days a week. But be warned you have to sign up fast as his classes fill up within mere days of registration opening for the upcoming semester and he is likely already filled up for fall 2019. But there is always spring 2020. Trust me you will love him. He is very smart, great at getting back to basics for those not grasping concepts and needing help and he is very understanding of life while not being a pushover. He may dock you points but chances are you can still turn in assignments late for a 10 or 15 point deduction sort of thing. No guarantees he will always do so, but he is a good person and a great professor who cares a lot about his student's success. You will truly get an amazing professor student relationship and the he posts video of every single lecture via overhead camera so you can see all his force diagrams and math to YouTube so you can always rewatch lectures instead of having to dog through books looking for some obscure thing you forgot the name of. Just go back to the day he lectured on it and watch the video at 2x speed or whatever u til you fond where he taught the part you are searching for. I cannot sing his praises enough. Just be honest with him and chances are if you are coming from a place of integrity and hard work and he sees you trying your best then he will help you. He, unfortunatly, lost his mother the semester I took him and while he was depressed he never treated us any different and all I can say is I really look up to him. He even wrote me my letter of recommendation for UT transfer admission into the school of physics for spring 2020. Of course he wouldnt let me see the letter so I hope he didn't tell them to avoid me at all costs hahaha jk. Oh and he is UT alumni so that is cool. Seriously he is like a solid 9/10.

Sounds like your major problems are  1.) You feel like an outsider, 2.) School is not a high enough priority for you

I don't know if you have ever had a 9-5 job, but if you are commuting so far it will make life easier to just plan on being on campus 9-5 every weekday. Go to class, do your homework, go to the gym, and make some friends. Do something enjoyable during your commute like listening to music, podcast, audiobook or call someone on the phone. Calling someone is probably the best thing you can do with that slot of time.

McCombs gives some great opportunities and you will make your future a lot brighter if you put the work in now. Schedule an hour or two of free time in the evenings to enjoy and make sure you get enough sleep. But other than that, your focus should be school if you want to make a come back. Once you start seeing your grades improve you will feel much better.

As for networking, even engineers have to network, man. It's just a game you have to learn to play or you will end up getting left behind. You'd be surprised at how bad people are at it though, so you really have nothing to lose. It's as simple as: 1.) introduce yourself, 2.) ask them about themselves, 3.) keep asking about their interests and make them feel clever and intelligent (this is trust-building), 4.) exchange contact information  


EDIT: I'm not telling you to kiss ass because people are good as smelling out fakeness. Everyone has at least one thing that is interesting about them that you can easily compliment on.

I understand being nervous about talking about suicidal thoughts. It’s something I’ve done before and it wasn’t easy. I do what you to know that just because you say you’ve had thoughts of killing yourself, it’s not like they’re gonna put you in a mental hospital against your will.

On one hand, you have now learned in your first semester what it takes many a lot longer to learn: college is HARD. More specifically, engineering is stupid difficult, and EE 306 is one of those classes that once you get behind, you're liable to catch up if you want to salvage yourself.

&gt; if i don't pass i'm going to lose my scholarship
Honestly, you should start to make plans in case you can't salvage. I don't know what the average was for 306 this year, but something tells me you're not close.

So, here's the deal with 306. You HAVE to work topic-to-topic, and it's basically useless to move onto the next topic until you understand the previous one super super well. This is also the case with 302, and it'll be the case worth 411, 316, etc.
 
 &gt; i try to study by reading the textbook, but i can't grasp concepts and apply them. im only good at memorization.

You should try studying other ways! Have you been going to the Sunday-Thursday tutoring sessions in EER 0.814 from 7-10pm? Have you been going to office hours (for both the TA and the professor)? Have you tried studying with others?

&gt; is it too late for me? is there any hope? should i q drop the class?

Yes, you should Q-drop the class. I honestly don't see how you'll pull out of this well.

&gt; also if i drop ee306, will i still be able to graduate in 4 years?

Yeah, you can still graduate in 4 years in ECE.

&gt; i feel like it would be too difficult for me to transfer out of ece.

It's not that hard, if you legit think you don't like ECE and want to transfer out you should look into your options.

&gt; i wish i had just done cs instead

If you think ECE is hard, you definitely shouldn't wish you had done CS. Also, transferring into CS is the exception from above: don't waste your effort trying to transfer.

&gt;should i q drop the class? also if i drop ee306, will i still be able to graduate in 4 years? 

The best people to help you with this are the TAs and/or Dr. Patt. I'm TA'ing EE 306 for Dr. Patt this semester. It would be great to meet up, get a coffee or something, and figure this out. If you're not willing to meet (for any reason), then message me here and let's chat over reddit. As of now, I don't have enough information to comment. I want to help you with the auxiliary stress/fear that comes with being in EE -- learning the material is hard enough as it is! 

I will say that I met with a student today. They saw \*this\* post, got scared, and told me they were thinking about dropping the class. They got a 16 on Exam 1. I sent them a blank copy of the test and asked them to re-attempt it (without books, notes, help of any kind). They were able to earn more than 16 points on question 1 alone! All in all, they were able to get above a 90 on Exam 1. We talked about why they struggled with the exam, how they were feeling about EE, and more. At the end of the day, they decided not to drop and felt better about continuing the rest of the semester. 

The last thing I want to say about this: we heavily weight your final grade based on the final exam and exam 2. In fact, Dr. Patt said in class that we're willing to ignore your Exam 1 grade when determining your final grade. He is most concerned with where you're at when the semester ends. If you're doing great when the semester ends, then we're not going to give you a low grade because you didn't know what was going on in October. 

All that said, I'm not trying to convince you to stay in the class if it's not the right thing for you. I do want to help you make a fully informed decision. Dropping the class is not the end of the world. Quite a few students drop the class, re-take it in the Spring, and finish EE in 4 years. In summary, please get in touch with me :) the more info I have, the better advice I can give! 

&gt;but i just don't really learn well with his teaching methods... i also have missed lots of class from getting sick and im just very very behind. 

I'm sorry you got sick, that can really f up a semester. I'll have a couple more questions about this when/if we chat. 

&gt;i really don't understand anything at all.    
&gt;  
&gt;i also bombed one of the lab assignments for 306...  
&gt;  
&gt;im only good at memorization.   
&gt;  
&gt;im actually really dumb and i dont think i belong in ece or at ut. everyone is big brain and im just a smol brain. rip. pls help i criiiiii /:

With more perspective, you can judge these situations better. You're being excessively hard on yourself. 

&gt; i try to study by reading the textbook, but i can't grasp concepts and apply them. is it too late for me? is there any hope? do i even like ece in the first place? why am i here? 

This is among the many things we should talk about! Again, if you don't want to meet up in person, please take a sec to message me on reddit. Like a few others have said: you're not alone in feeling this way! I transferred to UT from ACC and felt like a ""smol brain"" for my first couple years at UT.

The generic advice is to join organizations, and that's because the overall idea is to be a part of something you enjoy or around people with similar interests. I play Pokemon go a lot and I picked it up dramatically after going through what I did and it helped me so much. I met new people and it got me outside, something that I feel unmotivated to do quite often. Pokemon go or not, find something you enjoy and make it a hobby that can turn into something you can use to cope with. I went to therapy at the university to help talk through what I was feeling and my concerns. I wasn't a big fan of therapy bc I hate having to talk about things, but some sessions were a breakthrough for me. Maybe seeing a therapist to get onto a good path would be a good idea, it really helped me get to a good place in life.

Honestly, I think the best thing to do when you feel like your life is empty is to learn to fill that emptiness with things other than just people and relationships. That’s not to say you should just commit to being alone forever, but taking a little while to learn to be alone can be really mentally/spiritually helpful. You can focus on self-improvement, your goals, and having fun doing what you want to do without depending on the wants/needs of others.

I recommend trying out creative hobbies, crafts, solo activities, and working your way back up to finding friends and joining organizations. In the long run, finding strategies for feeling okay being by yourself is something that will do wonders for your mental health.

P.S., if things get really bad and the advice you receive doesn’t help, UT CMHC offers something like six free counseling sessions per semester, and there are other programs in Austin that offer free/low cost mental health services for low income families and college students.

I'm not sure how much you know about TSTV, but in short it's a student run television network and you can sign up to participate in student written and run shows. They're very easy to sign up for and join, and there might even be some shows that need some animation. 

There's also almost always something with film going on, you just have to put yourself out there and talk to people. Especially at this point in the semester I've seen a lot of upperclassmen reaching out to every corner of RTF and UT looking for people to help out on set. It's a great way to get experience and meet people.

If your usage is down to nothing after everything is off, start connecting things one at a time to see what their usage is.

The first two years are bogged down by the core curriculum and you have to complete 60 hours as well as the four intro to RTF classes before you can even think of doing elective courses. 

There are definitely things to do outside the program, but you have to find most of them for yourself. The animation courses seem genuinely great though and I even plan on trying to take a few in the future.

The real issue with the class is the lab section. Babler has no control over the lab portion, the lab professor does it all.  If it is run by a professor named Tim, DO NOT TAKE IT. It is poorly run and designed, his assignments often have errors which result in needless confusion, you spend the whole 4 hours lab taking notes from a poorly optimized computer program and doing an occasional “activity” that always feels like a waste of time. There is an entry and exit quiz for each lab, which are needlessly difficult and made by the TAs so they can be super confusing and have many errors. There are many other examples I can go on about, but I’ll just add three more that speak to Tim’s character and teaching style: 

1. If you are waiting in line after the exam time ends to Turn in/put your test in the turn in box, you get points off. Keep in mind this is a ~350 person class so there is little to no way this is doable. 

2.  His opening line of one of the first things he sent out, “this class is difficult. Don’t expect the TAs to spoon feed you information” (as someone who’s major is education/teaching, this bothers me so much because this is not the attitude you should have when it comes to teaching) 

3. The class average in the first exam was failing. He sent this in the information and then said “the next exam will be significantly more difficult”. There was no curve originally, but was added because of errors in the  key itself when put through the scantron machine. (Keep in mind that his rule or regraded is that you can not fight for your answer if you think something is right unless you finish the exam and write down why you think he is wrong, WHILE you are taking the exam AND you need to provide a source for that information. Keep in mind you don’t know if your answer is right or wrong till after the exam is graded. So fighting for your answer is rendered pretty much impossible even if you are correct.)

The consequences are performing poorly on the exam. If people can perform well on an exam without ever showing up for lecture, why does that matter? 

&gt; I think about classes like a job.

Thinking of classes like a job from a students perspective does make sense when it comes time for an exam. It does not completely make sense to make that comparison when it comes to attendance because attendance is not the result.

You say that, but I had professors at UT that would fail me for more than 3 days missing a semester, with no exceptions.

There's no accountability that a professor is held to that.

I had good attendance while at UT and personally had no problems with attendance, and enjoyed making it to most lectures, but I couldn't disagree more.

I remember selling my lunch the whole school year so I could pay my dues for the football team. That gets me back into my grind.

You got a wonderful support network and have tried going to get mental help and that's good. You're definitely not inactive. I don't know what would inspire you more: the fact that you have to pay tuition again or the disappointment in failing something doable. But I'd recommend focusing on what you have to do and do it. That being said, when you're on schedule or need a little break, use it. But don't let it take you away from your responsibilities for too long (set times?).

It's late but it's not impossible that you might be doing something that you're not interested in. As in, your goals have changed.

11366,"I hope I am not too late. The course itself is relatively easy if you do things her way. That's why she has bad reviews since she's very adamant on that.

Lecture portion: fairly standard. Everything she says in lecture supersedes whatever is mentioned in the book if there is a contradiction. So pay attention to lectures and the book is only there to reinforce understanding. A weird quirk is that she refuses to post powerpoints until after class. A bit annoying, but not too bad. Some topics are only seen in lecture. There is also an extra credit assignment at the end of class, they are essentially completion grades. Definitely do them. There is also other extra credit assignments too. She has learning objectives that you could (and should use) as outlines, they cover whats relevant for the exam. Some parts of the learning objective are not clear, but you can ask on what they mean. She also does not allow electronics unless you're sitting in the front rows. Interestingly, she is chill with letting tablets be used for note taking, many used them and they weren't on the front rows.

Exams: There are 3 exams and they are done in class usually in another room. She gives out a practice exam the lecture before that one (done in class to simulate testing conditions and she takes the time to review over it) and some questions in there appear in the actual midterm. I do not remember the ratio but there is a multiple choice portion and a written portion. Warning: The multiple choice is formatted such that one answer could be correct, multiple could be correct, or none are correct. She does this for all of them. Written portion has short answers, and an essay where you choose one prompt of the three in the exam. The exams are pretty meh, they aren't hard but do not underestimate them. No curve but the averages hover around the 80s when I took it, so it didn't really need one. You can contest grading on the exam, she isn't rude about it either but be sure you know what you're talking about.

Discussion portion: There are quizzes every discussion except the week before a midterm, and no discussion the week of a midterm. You have to do group work too. You do not get to choose your group mates and its randomized, though you do take a personality quiz on the first lecture and that may influence where you get placed. The project is standard fare, you come up with a proposal for a research study and there are weekly assignments. You present it too and have to answer questions the audience has (with the professor attending each discussion). It's tedious work but not hard and helps your grade.

&amp;#x200B;

In short, do things her way, and you will do well in the course. She is not forgiving if you need some leeway on something, or veer from what she wants. She may come off as standoffish in lectures, but I found she was a rather nice person in office hours. I can't say if you should take the course or not because everyone's different in how much they can handle. Decide for yourself if you think you could handle the course. People come into the course thinking its a cakewalk because of the grade distribution, but do not realize a lot of the course can get time consuming and there is strict guidelines to follow.

That being said, I don't think that mandatory recording of lectures is  necessarily a good idea- it has the potential to chill class discussion. As a COLA student who takes a lot of classes dealing with ""controversial"" topics (race, gender, religion, etc.), I've had several syllabi with some sort of non-disclosure statement on them- basically the professors ask that anything said in class be kept in class. When students are constantly policing themselves to not be problematic or sound dumb, it greatly hampers the learning process. Having to worry about everything you say being recorded and presumably posted somewhere is going to play all sorts of mind games on people, and ultimately lower the quality of class discussions. 

Obviously, this effect is going to be felt a lot more in discussion based classes than lecture based classes, but I think it still applies- students might be afraid to ask questions during lectures if they know they're being recorded.

IMO UT should get rid of mandatory attendance policies, and just make students responsible for learning and absorbing materials- get notes from friends, read the text book, whatever you gotta do",0.0118,0.1382,0.85

11453,"Hey, OP. I want you to know that sometimes these things aren't your fault. Many of my high school friends went to UT with me, and we all entered into different programs. My program hosts events every week, and I made fast friends and had a wonderful support network. My friend who wasn't in an honors program made a grand total of 0 friends. Another friend of mine WAS in an honors program that had far fewer events, and didn't make any friends until her senior year. 


I just want you to know that some environments are more conducive to community than others. Some colleges/workspaces/programs are very tight knit and well run. Others leave you on the curbside. Yes, it's important to take initiative, but that will be far easier in some places than in others. 

I know it's late now, but when you're deciding on your med school, go to a place that emphasizes student life and community. Many things like Princeton Review will tell you which schools specialize in student happiness and which are insanely competitive. Yes, it's harder to make friends as an adult, but it all depends on where you are, if your job holds events vs puts you in cubicles, if your school is cut throat vs nurturing, etc. Do not think for one moment that this is 100% your fault. Yes, there are steps you could have taken to increase your chances of getting friends, but in some places (UT included) those steps are immensely more difficult to take. Get into a med school that has happy and close knit students, and you will become a happy and close knit student.

As long as you lock the frame and both wheels in some way and it's locked to something secure (not a tree that they'll just cut!) and locked somewhere visible, it'll probably be OK.

Don't get a nice bike -- get a beater bike, something that doesn't look valuable.  Consider making it look even crappier by adding lots of stickers, [but maybe not this sticker](https://www.securityinfowatch.com/education/news/10558834/on-campus-ooops-this-bike-wasnt-a-pipe-bomb).

Lock it up every time, even if it's only for five minutes, even if it's just sitting next to you as you do your homework or something outside.  (In the latter case, ""self-locking"" where you just immobilize a wheel is probably OK, but that's the only case where that's OK.)

If at all possible, don't leave it locked up outside overnight.  But if you can't avoid this, make sure it's locked with at least two locks, at least one of them *must* be a good U-lock (cable locks suck), make sure both wheels and the frame are locked (and you can also lock the seat to the frame with its own chain if you're serious), it's not a good looking bike, and it's locked up in a visible area with nicer looking bikes locked up in ways that aren't as good ... you're usually OK.",0.2265,0.4793,0.2943

Perhaps you are suffering from some type of anxiety and I hate the idea of you being alone. Please look into the school's resources so you can hopefully overcome this and lead a much happier life. You have to take the initiative. No one else can begin to help you if you dont first start the process of improvement. Luckily being in school still means you have access to much more affordable or even free help that would cost much more after graduation. I encourage you to get help and wish you a wonderful life.  You can be happy and have a great life, you just need to be honest with yourself and accept help in the areas you see yourself suffering in. Everyone has different problems they must overcome, you aren't special or broken. You are just as deserving of a great life full of fun, friends and fulfillment and you are just as capable of reaching that goal as everyone else.  I wish you the best. Don't give up on yourself. You CAN overcome your troubles. 95% of people are much more forgiving and understanding than we imagine them to be so dont be afraid to put yourself out there and talk to strangers. Just because we wouldnt forgive ourselves or dont think we are special doesnt mean that other people feel the same way. Often people are much more forgiving than we give them credit for.

11530,"&gt;I bet requring this for EVERY class would be incredibly expensive and probably raise tuition so I'm against this one

Just for fun, I decided to see *how* incredibly expensive this might be.

If we assume a 15-week semester and 3 hour-per-week class, that's 45 hours. There are 12,400+ courses offered^(1) (and I'm assuming the same material is taught in every section of a course) so we'd be looking at 558,000 hours of recorded lectures per long semester.

Now, how much disk space that will take may vary wildly, so let's arbitrarily select **H.264 720** which provides 720p at 23.98fps (as opposed to 1080p or 4K) which takes up roughly 20.76 GB per hour of footage^(2). That works out to 11,584,080 GB or 11.58 Petabytes.

Now, all of that has to be stored somewhere. Using some cloud storage prices I found online, the price I got was $5/mo for the first 250 GB and $0.02/GB for each additional GB^(3). That works out to $231,681.60 per month.

Subsequently, as another comment noted, those recordings are university/state property and therefore subject to record retention rules. In my decidedly non-expert opinion, I believe these recordings would qualify as ""Course Records"" and therefore have a retention requirement of 5 years after the end of the semester^(4).

For simplicity, I won't even count the semester itself. 60 months of retention at $231,681.60 per month works out to a total of $13,900,896 per semester of material.

And that's **just** the data storage cost.

In order to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), all of that would need to be transcribed for closed captioning. The Internet suggests^(5) that it takes a trained transcriptionist four to five hours to transcribe a single hour of video content. Assuming the lower mark, that's 2,232,000 work hours. That same online resource notes that most vendors charge per minute (we're at 133,920,000 minutes) and will charge anywhere from $1 to $15 per minute. Assuming the bargain basement price of $1/minute, that's $133,920,00 which has now increased the overall cost to $834,053,760 per semester of material.

Notably, this doesn't include the network transfer costs (ballpark $0.01/GB), the equipment costs (cameras, microphones, lighting, etc.), the labor costs involved in the recording, the costs of backing up the media (more disk and network costs), the cost of the IT staff to maintain the infrastructure (roughly $160K per year), and so forth.

So, *very* rough ballpark figure, this would cost the university **an additional $850 million per long semester**. Which, divided among 50,000 students, would work out to an additional $17,000 per semester per student.

Again, caveat emptor, this is a *very* rough Sunday morning guesstimate and may not reflect reality in the slightest.

However, It’s doable tho. Like others have mentioned, RECORD EVERYTHING. she sometimes does give you clues about what to know and what to not know. “You don’t need to memorize this, but you DO need to note that... blah blah blah” so that sorta helps. 

I didn’t get the book bc many people who’ve taken the class have said that it’s not necessary. what’s on the exam is basically everything she talks about and the book tends to go into a lot more detail than what’s needed. But if you’re the kind of person that needs extra material, than go for it. 

In the end tho, she drops your lowest quiz and homework assignment (DQ)! but no exams are dropped.

11677,"This is so fucking wrong it hurts me. Your other comments in this thread show that you have some good perspectives, but this shit is toxic and just... wrong!

First off, college is an environment that introduces and aggravates mental illness. You have to synthesize the information from 4-7 disparate courses, work on large, complicated assignments with tight, unrealistic deadlines, and stomach the anxiety of constant exams that you may or may not know how to prepare for -- all in the span of a mere 4 months. And a month after you do it once? Buckle up and do it the fuck again. Any failure feels like death, any blip on your record feels like a curse, marring any bright future you might have had otherwise.

If you think THAT -- college -- is representative of normal adult life, you are severely fucking mistaken. The mental burden of all that shit can really weigh you down and prevent you from connecting with people, and afterwards it can be like you're walking on air. 

Secondly, it's just not that easy to connect with people sometimes. I am a totally functional human being who seems like a bubbly, out-going people-person at work. I'm friendly and warm to most people, and I'm passionate and loud and I love to laugh. Still, I have a really really hard time connecting to others, putting myself out there is not really a factor. Sometimes things just don't click. And sometimes you're just trying to click with the wrong people. Putting the burden of shame on the person struggling is unfair and not helpful, in my opinion. 

Also putting yourself out there with mental illness suuuucks. Definitely gotta figure out that mind first, and then things start to make more sense.

You are right that college does provide a lot more opportunities to meet people than life after, though. But I will just say that in Austin, there are soooo many meetups and things to do to meet people, that it's not so bad. 

Still, I wanna say this for any non-seniors out there reading this -- sometimes transfer is the answer!! Don't write yourself off because of this place, try a clean slate somewhere else! I have a lot of regrets from college (most of which were not gonna happen because of my brain being a dick), and one of them was not transferring out and trying it all somewhere else.

I believe the structure is the same as other SDS 328M classes - weekly homework, R lab once a week, three exams, and a project you have to do at the end. 

What I particularly liked about Hernandez was that he had bonus point opportunities for exams through his exam reviews you do the class before. That helped even though the exams themselves were also pretty straightforward (similar to homework). And also, he let us skip the poster presentation final. Instead of having to go and present to him and the TAs, he let us submit the poster online and that was it. This was nice cause of finals and everything.

You don't have to have a particularly high GPA, but you'd want to have A/B grades in your math and science courses. You could even have a bad grade IF it was during your first semester and IF your math/science grades improved in the subsequent semester(s.)

You'll also need to write a good essay discussing your academic, personal, and career interests relating to astronomy.

The Astronomy (and physics) student organizations are open to any interested students, so if you aren't already involved, joining  might be a good way to demonstrate interest and learn more about the major from current students.

It's not a *bad* program per say, but you can't count on learning skills in the program that will land you a job like you could with a ""safer"" major. A degree from UT looks pretty good no matter what major you are, but in AET if you want to land a job you have to have skills developed outside of the program to sell yourself on, because AET alone isn't going to cut it.

My personal biggest problem is with AET faculty. For a multidisciplinary, high tech major, many of the faculty are far behind the cutting edge and some are even bordering on technologically deficient honestly. This is changing with new hires, but has been slow progress.

The classes are always being changed and adapted, anyone in AET right now is a guinea pig as they try and figure out what classes are good and which ones aren't. If you look at the AET course schedule, a downright appalling number have been cancelled and professors are stretched across many different classes, meaning you're not getting specialized instruction. Some professors don't even know the content of the course they are signed up to teach.

With all that being said, the program hasn't all been bad for me. I have learned a fair deal in many of my classes, even if a lot of that information will never be relevant to me as I change my career trajectory with grad school.",0.1512,0.4276,0.4212

fwiw, i'm not advocating for skipping classes, and i don't think any amount of online lectures will be able to replace going to upper division/graduate classes.  in particular, you never get a chance to interrupt lectures with your questions. also a classroom lecture setting forces you to be more alert than watching a youtube video in your bathrobe on your bed. also rec letters for grad school.  

that being said, i've actually taken some measures to start doing this in my department. tagging /u/annaies for visibilbity, the way i went about this is to message the dean of my department directly with this idea of recording lectures. professors won't be held liable for these kinds of things, it's done on the dept level instead (although you need the professor's personal permission to record him). if you're interested in more info pm me. my motivation doesn't stem from wanting to not go to class; i simply need to to hear the material multiple times because it's so dense first time around, and this is a shared opinion among my classmates

**My story:** 

I started with FRI and got placed in a chem lab I HATED. Quit that after freshman year. 

Emailed around and found a spot in a pharmacology lab for the summer. Didn't do much but pet and weigh rats and quit in the fall because they wanted me to come in at 5:30am every morning. 

Dropped research for two year, then before my senior year I applied for a DAAD Summer research project in Germany and was handily rejected (they go based on GPA though, so apply if you've got a good one!). BUT I'm stubborn. 

I emailed all the researchers I wrote cover letters for and asked if I could still come if I were self-funded. At the same time, I emailed an advisor at UT who oversaw research funds for the school. He agreed to fund my research.

My senior year I did a thesis. I did it on a historical topic, but it gave me some street cred. Not many applicants have written 70 page topics on a niche subject. I put it on my app as research (it is) and was brought up in interviews.

**I'd say the best ways I saw people finding research were:**

\- those email updates that get sent out by SURGe (undergrad research group, join their mailing list:  [https://w3.biosci.utexas.edu/surge/?page\_id=95](https://w3.biosci.utexas.edu/surge/?page_id=95))

\- cold emailing. Find people on EUREKA but then find their lab's actual web page. Be sure to have THREE semesters to commit. Be sure you've actually read some of their publications and have an idea of what they do.

\- cold emailing after seeing a cool poster in the hallway or some talk a professor is doing. They were honestly way more receptive to this.

\- animal behavior research had a lot more opportunities while I was at UT. Business and sociology also had some options. Don't limit your choices, they all are legit in the eyes of med school. Esp. if you aren't actually that excited by PCR.

\- freshman research initiative is the easiest in.

\- talking to friends already in labs, then name dropping in your email. ""I am in X class/org with Y person, who is a student in your lab. Y told me about the novel work you are doing in Z and I was wondering..."" (but do it better and make sure they know you're planning to mention them!!!)",0.3139,0.5298,0.1562

Only do things where if someone asked you why you did it, you'd have a real interest and could sustain a conversation. Not just about WHAT you did, but why you did it. This applies to all of life.

For standing out, I had a non-science major as well as a science major. I also did a lot of cancer advocacy while at UT (like, thousands of hours) and a lot of student and local government.

12011,"For shadowing, I found some people via connections with my family (my dad does loans and stays in touch with all his clients) and the others I found by cold emailing. HOWEVER, I'd highly recommend joining a pre-med interested group like Kappa Rho or AED. They should be able to help set stuff up. If you can't, ask your family to ask around, someone's facebook friend will know some physician. You could even join some Austin specific FB groups and ask there. If you guys have a family physician, you can start there!

For volunteering, I did a LOT and the majority was not medical. I probably had 3000 house of non-medical volunteering and \~150 hours of medical volunteering. I'd \*highly\* recommend looking into Dell Children's or CD Doyle. CD Doyle will teach you a lot of very useful clinical skills, the undergrads really do work. I'd also look into kids summer camps, if that interests you. Austin is pretty close to Camp For All, which has a lot of summer camps for kids with special medical needs. It's a blast and fast hours on weekends or over the summer. If you like adults, hospice can be sad but also very humbling. Usually easy to get a volunteering spot at hospice, but requires more training.

Everything that wasn't unit 3 was what we had missed on the previous midterms. She'll tell you the learning objectives that you should focus on around dead week. I didn't find it too hard.

She'll say what specific things are on the test and she allows you to get a cheat sheet so it's quite nice and you'll have plenty of time to complete all the tests and quizzes (that is if the test includes question 2 on the paper and the TA doesnt have to write it on the board with 15 minutes left &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;_____&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;).

12242,"**Drink/Party**

The student population only makes up \~2.5% of the 2.16 million people in the Austin metro so there aren't that many ""college bars"" that are strictly students. Generally speaking, there are four big bar areas that students go to, all in/near downtown:

Dirty Sixth (from Congress Ave. to Red River St.): Probably the most popular spot for UT students, especially the younger ones. Think Bourbon Street. Lots of cheap shots/drinks, rowdy drunk people, loud music, crowded.

West 6th (from West Ave. to San Antonio St.) : Popular with older students. A slightly cleaner, older crowd than Dirty Sixth. More grown-up versions of Dirty 6th bars.

Rainey Street: Popular with older students. A street of old bungalow houses turned into bars. Pretty clean and relaxed.

East 6th (east of I-35 to Chicon St.): Less popular with undergrads, but more popular with grad students. Hipster-y. Some breweries, chill cocktail lounges, hip dive bars.

The only college bar I can think of is Cain and Abel's in west campus, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to an out-of-towner since it's not that memorable. Posse East/Crown and Anchor are decent spots to grab a beer but I wouldn't spend my night at either one.

**Tailgate**

Walk around the stadium and try to join a tailgate. There is no centralized tailgating area except for the paid, corporate-type tailgates near the stadium on the lawn of the LBJ Library. The rest is spread out.

I saw KSU is having a meet-up at Little Woodrows downtown before the game. Check ""Kansas State Texans"" on FB for more info.

Scholz near campus is an old German beer garden that gets popular before UT games. Walking distance to stadium.

If you look back at how you made all of your closest friends, a lot of times, you won't be able to remember because those friendships happened naturally. No one forced you to be friends, it just kinda happened at some point in time, but because you guys were both doing the same thing as each other, you guys formed an immediate bond. These friendships are often the most valuable, but they can only happen if you put yourself out there.

The Jackson School is both old and new. It traces its origins to a Department of Geology founded in 1888 but became a separate unit at the level of a college only on September 1, 2005. The school's formation resulted from gifts by the late John A. and Katherine G. Jackson initially valued at $272 million.

&gt; Opossums are generally nocturnal, foraging throughout the night. But it is not at all unusual to see an opossum out during the daytime, especially during cold weather. They also can be seen in the day when food is scarce or when they have been disturbed from their sleeping quarters. The winter months will see many opossums change their foraging habits from night to day in order to try to take advantage of the warmer weather during sunlight hours.

So, apparently this behavior is normal, especially when its cold

I will also note that opossums generally have a way lower chance of getting rabies than most animals. its not impossible of course, but bc of their body temp they are just really really resistant to it. So, probably+hopefully not that?",0.1524,0.5022,0.3454

12446,"I don't go to UT so I'm not going to anyway anything specific to the school but I went to a different college for one year before dropping out and you sound a lot like me during that time. 

My first semester I was depressed and really didn't do well. I ended it with two Cs and two Fs. One of the F classes I actually kicked ass in but forgot about the final essay and started it late. Wasn't able to even get past the intro before admitting defeat.  

I got approved for accommodations either the end of the first semester or beginning of the second but didn't actually use many because I really couldn't think of any that would help. I did go to a quiet study room they had and was allowed extra time for exams, that helped a lot. Also, wish I had taken advantage of having another student give me their notes for the class since it seemed I could either pay attention or hurry trying to keep up with notes.

Next semster I did much better (I think two As and two Bs) but it just wasn't enough. I was placed on academic suspension. I could have kept going, just on probation or whatever but I used it as a reason to get out.

I struggled with school my whole life when it came to certain tasks and I'm so much happier now. I'm not saying you should drop out, just that even the ""worst case scenario"" like I had can work out just fine. Even if you end up leaving like me it doesn't mean you're a failure. You gave it a shot and had to work harder than a lot of people, no shame in that (especially if you're happier elsewhere)

I got diagnosed during senior year of high school. It worked like this:

Went to doctor and explained that I think I have ADHD. He gave me a test on an Ipad and I scored very high. He then **referred** me to a psychiatrist.

Went to the psychiatrist and he prescribed me Vyvanse (worked well for the most part but I no longer feel the need to take it because I am no longer in school.) Once I started college I ""transferred my files"" - or whatever - to the University.

After the first semester, I called Student Services and set up an appointment. Your documented diagnosis serves as proof that you're eligible for accommodations. 

Now, for you most of this will probably work through the school but Student Services should be a great start. Just start asking questions

Also, it's a good idea to be open with your professors. Just like with any job, you don't need to say ""I have ADHD"" but rather ""I struggle with time management and ordination but some of my strengths are flexibility and creative thinking."" Lots of people, including college professors, don't truly understand ADHD (depsite how much they might think they do) and saying you have it right out of the gate could cause them to have preconceptions about you. Once you're diagnosed though, of course let them know and work with them to find which accommodations work for you.

Also remember, it's a good idea to have an open mind about the possibility that you don't have ADD/ADHD. There's lots of things that have overlapping symptoms and that can make it look like you have it. 

**That being said,** if a doctor doesn't take your concerns seriously then find a new doctor. If you are a legal adult, they shouldn't need anybody as a reference or anything like that. 

This was long but I hope it helps you out. If you're like me, you don't leave your dorm very much. I should've taken my ex's advice and spent more time with friends, or at least go for a walk. Try to keep it in mind :)",0.3404,0.4589,0.2006

12450,"Start with CMHC. If they can’t give you all the help you need then they will give you a list of resources in the community. Many mental health practitioners in Austin operate on a sliding scale payment system, meaning that, without insurance, you will pay a % based on your income. I don’t know the exact requirements for accommodations but I got my documentation from a psychiatric nurse practitioner, so I’m sure a licensed psychologist or psychiatrist would be more than adequate. One warning, though: I would advise you against acting eager to receive an ADHD diagnosis as this may get you labeled as a drug seeker. Don’t go in directly saying “I think I have ADHD” - say more subtle things like “I’ve had trouble concentrating and want to see what might be wrong.” If you have a competent doctor then they will order basic blood work to rule out things like thyroid dysfunction, vitamin deficiencies etc. (If they don’t bring this up of their own accord, find a new doctor.) Needless to say, diet, exercise and sleep are all important and you should work on optimizing these as much as possible regardless of whether you decide to take medication. And yes, strictly speaking you need to have displayed symptoms as a child to receive a diagnosis, but that’s “strictly speaking” and many doctors won’t care, especially if you explain your situation. On paper, ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that begins in childhood (or earlier) but in reality it’s cluster of symptoms that can wax and wane throughout one’s life or even appear out of nowhere at any age. Needless to say, do all of this ASAP so you can get your accommodations for next semester. I don’t think there’s a deadline, so to speak, but it will be better if you get an intake appointment, meet your SSD coordinator and familiarize yourself with accommodations before the next round of classes starts.",0.0722,0.4667,0.4611

12653,"wow thank you for taking the time to write all this!

how hard was it for you to transfer from BME to ECE? I've heard that transferring in UT is pretty difficult.

i'm not planning on going to med school/premed, but at some point in high school I definitely thought I was going to do it, so it's not like I'm not open to the idea of med school. I'm also planning on going to graduate school, but obviously a lot can change quickly.

Also, I'm aware that the career prospects for BME are slim compared to other engineering majors (specially for a bachelor's degree in BME from what I've heard). I think I'll just go with BME for now, see how it goes, and try to transfer out if I want to. I really like this major and have wanted to do it for a while, so my only concern is the job opportunities - but I've heard from other people that it is possible, it just requires more effort to find a job specifically in BME compared to other engineering majors like ME and ECE.",0.489,0.4152,0.0958
12654,"I don’t have any thing to add , but I relate to you! I’m a freshman as well and oh boy, I hated it here the first weeks and regretted not staying home where I would be saving a lot of money, so I’m not entirely sure if I would stay here at UT, but know that a lot of first years feel the same way as you :D , hopefully you get to figure out everything else ! The only advice I have is to maybe talk to an advisor or a CS major that transferred! Good luck :)",0.4856,0.3425,0.172
12655,"I was a first semester BME and switched into ECE the second semester. The two main reasons why I switched were:

* We used Lego NXT in the first semester, introduction course to BME (BME 303L). I'm not sure if you're familiar with Lego NXT, but it's rather commonly used by kids and is meant to teach them the basics of programming through graphical means.

* Going to Expo (job fair) and talking to International Biomedical Company. While they did have some BMEs, they basically told me that the biology part they can teach on the job, but they're not going to teach programming/embedded system design, all of which you learn in ECE. 

With that out of the way, reasons why I chose BME in the first place:

* Initially, I applied to UT planning to go to medical school and engineering would be a fall black plan if I decided I wasn't into biology/chemistry/organic chemistry.

* It helps you stand out to medical schools among the sea of biology/biochemistry/chemistry majors.

The reasons why I switched:

* ECE is more flexible in its degree plan then BME. After doing a bit of planning (and coming in with a lot of AP credits), I realized that I could do premed and ECE. It's not as hard as you would think. I haven't made less than an A- in a premed required course (I'm going to say that M 408D - Calculus II doesn't count here...), and I'm hoping that if I did apply to medical school, they would overlook my cGPA in favor of my high sGPA.

* ECE majors are actually wanted for at the career fair (Expo) and getting an internship your sophomore/junior year is very feasible.

Why you should want BME/Pros of BME:

* The sense of community. I'd say it's the tightest knit major in engineering. You share classes with the same people, over and over, and making friends is fairly easy.

* You want to go to graduate school. This is where I could see the courses (see below) being useful. 

* You want to go to medical school in a ""special"" fashion, and the ""special""-ness really appeals to you. Or, you're just an engineer at heart and you like the idea of analytically solving problems/want to get better at analytic problem solving (which will be useful in *life*). 

Why you shouldn't want BME/Cons of BME:

* BME is full of required ""BME"" courses, which are really just biology emphasized versions of Mech E or ECE courses. It leads to you needing 15 hours/semester, more or less, and no company really appreciates the rigor of the program because you don't go into enough depth to be useful to them.

* Getting into industry isn't impossible, but my impression is it's more difficult to do from BME than ECE. Not to say it's impossible - but there are easier ways in engineering.

tl;dr: 

ECE courses 🙁. At expo 😊. 😊 for graduate school (different reasons).

BME courses 🙁. At expo 😢. 😐 for medical school. 😊 for graduate school.",0.5711,0.4012,0.0278

my uncle started off at UT. He chose electrical engineering. By his second year he didn’t have the grades. He did not want to change majors (so kind of backwards of where you are) and his only option was to choose another engineering if he wanted to stay at UT. He wasn’t willing to switch so he left UT. He saw it more as “following his passion” and ee was his passion. He did CAP backwards lol. He transferred to UT San Antonio where he finished ee with no problem. He is now a pretty successful electrical engineer and doesn’t regret his choice. He interviews engineers now and says he couldn’t care less where they went to school because he often finds that just because they graduated from top schools doesn’t mean they have the creativity he’s looking for or others just can’t work well with others.

For one, you can definitely get a certificate in cs with a meche degree; with this, you can of course get a cs job. Meches getting a cs job is not unheard of

Thermo, heat trans, fluids, materials. That's roughly the 1st half of me. You can power through these, and can even take these courses at a school near your home city, like UT Dallas or UT Tyler. Carefull planning is req. As these are pre reqs for other courses

The other half I feel you'll do decent, 
Like dynamics, statics, solids, machine elements, and especially mechatronics, dsc. 
Unfortunately, mechatronics and dsc are upper level courses. 
What Im trying to say is meche is so broad, and as a senior now, I definitely enjoy my upper div classes alot more than the lower div classes. Personally, I've powered through those lower div classes and completed all my lab class in two semesters.

12812,"Not to discourage you, but if you’re doing poorly on calc and chem I don’t know how well you’d do as a CS major. 

Have you taken an actual look into CS? There are many different fields within the major—network, machine learning, AI, security, etc. So do you already have a field or interest in mind?

Also the course work for CS is very intensive and some are math(logic/proof) heavy— algorithm, discrete maths, linear algebra, automata, etc. 

Again not to discourage you, but if you’re already having a hard time as an mechanic engineer, I guarantee you’re going to have an even harder time as a CS major. 

After considering what I stated prior, if you are still interested in the CS route, take a break from UT(or while taking electives at UT), and apply to any community college. Take intro comp sci courses(1,2), discrete math 1, and linear algebra. See how you like it, and you can apply to transfer your major at UT. UTD also has a fast track to master’s for CS which is very nice. 

Lastly, CS major won’t actually hold your hands and teach you how to code. It’s more theoretical, concept, and abstract based. So if you’re not passionate about CS, it’s really not something I’d recommend.

If your goal is to become a software engineer, any major is actually fine. So long as you understand run time analysis, and whiteboard interviews(there are many websites to help you study/prepare and thousands of resources everywhere) you are good to go. 

Nowadays most companies for software positions have first “interviews” done online(few mc questions about logic/code/runtime and few coding questions). Getting those interviews are very easy, but passing them is another story. Since they’re all automated, it helps companies screen out actual knowledgeable coders vs paper degree holders. So don’t be too discouraged about your current situation, spend some time to research what career you want to pursue/field you want to specialize, and decide from there.

You don't learn the really important fundamentals of computer science like data structures, algorithms, etc. It's hobbyist level programming.

Just really annoys me that UT raised the prices of J2 and Kinsolving to 10 bucks per entry.

Instead they jack up the prices and include it in those unlimited plans for freshman on campus housing plans who don’t even know the difference.

Like I’m taking out a fortune in loans to pay for only three months rent for a crappy apartment with three roommates that’s 20 minute walk from campus, working 20 hours to pay for groceries, while on campus dining is overcrowded and expensive too, I don’t have a car because I can’t pay for one partly because parking lot fees are crazy and now they’re raising tuition! What does UT expect I’m not made out of money! this is just another decision showing that UT doesn’t give a crap about student well being and only cares about their wallets but that’s every college in America.

I studied extra hard for the second test and bombed it too. So I went into her office hours to see her, which is something that I had NEVER done with any professor. We talked for awhile and she asked me questions about the material and saw that I knew it. I just didn't present it in the fashion that she was looking for (essay answers). She told me how to write a good response for her then let me take the exam over. I ended up with an A on the exam and an A in the class and then got an A in her next class. 

Talking to your professors is so helpful. Most of them don't want to fail a student, especially in today's world (they were a lot more harsh 30 years ago!).  Go in and let the professor know how hard you are studying and that your grades don't reflect it. Ask for their advice about how to do better. How to study effectively for the exams, etc. I think you may be pleasantly surprised. 

We have a 3rd year LHD who sees every professor multiple times a month. It makes a world of difference. They know her and know she is a hard worker. They can later serve as references for her and I think it helps her understand their classes and their material better. UT is a hard school and you may not get a 4.0 in every class.

In my other classes needed for where I was at in my degree plan, it was harder to make friends as everyone was 3rd or 4th year and the content was too advanced for someone who just transferred into a new environment.

Go to every class. Make sure that you go to office hours! That was probably the biggest thing for me. They weren't much a thing at my cc and I didn't really know how to ask for help. I didn't figure this stuff out until late in my time at UT, but you're only one semester or two in! You've got this, you can do this, you belong!

EDIT: Looked at your history a bit and saw you're in CSD. Now's when you go from blowing off the 'hurr durr moody is ez' a-holes to punching them in the face. My fianceé did her grad studies in that program and it is no joke. You are definitely in one of the top schools in the country for what you're studying.

Tho I’m not sure if it was just with my class (she did tell us at the end she’d been going through some stuff). Whenever we had people go up to the board to write answers she would go over the accents on everyone’s letters and just make them ridiculously big if they weren’t sufficient for her. I don’t remember if she said she’d take points off for that on graded assignments. Just little things you wouldn’t think were important that for some reason are. Like I said it may have been a one off thing. I just smiled and waved and got through with an easy A. It felt like a high school class in more ways than one.

I find most of the time I understand 98% but cant grasp something and tutoring almost always gives me that missing piece, that 2% that I missed or skipped over and that missing piece then allows everything to smoothly fall into place and come together into a single idea or skill or whatever and then you will be so excited because something that was hard for you will suddenly become easy and fun. Often people are just missing a little bit of info here or there and that is why they cannot understand a topic. A stand out in my mind was Kinematics in physics.   I Struggled and struggled until a tutor showed me that one thing(its been a while I dont remember what exactly it was) and suddenly a heavenly light shines forth upon my mind and everything made sense! I wanted to burst out kn song! And so do not be afraid to ask questions with tutors. If they show you a process or equation a,and you are still not understanding then keep digging and asking deeper and deeper questions. Break it down to elementary school level if you must. It doesnt matter. You do whatever you must to get to the root and find that understanding. You can do it and everyone, learns differently so never be ashamed about your process. All that matters is you seek out the help you need and you work to discover what you are missing. This time in your life is about improving yourself and that is all that matters.

13156,"While I do think it's important to be well versed in a topic before making an argument, it's impossible to know *everything* about a topic.  The problem arises when someone brings up a very specific, but still related subject that they specifically researched for, but is virtually impossible to have knowledge about unless you researched that specific topic too.

Like for this Thanksgiving argument, I can easily see there being situations where a Native American group did have a good relationship with the colonists. So even if you argue about some of the general problems with Thanksgiving, the other person can bring up those specific scenarios until they find one you don't know. Then they can just keep circling back to that scenario and act like they won because they found a counterexample that you don't have enough info to argue against, when in reality, there's still a bigger picture to consider.

As for the rest of what you’ve said; honestly I don’t get what your deal is. This isn’t a fight I care about. But here we go anyways...

1.	I never made up a definition, I said we thought of it differently. I didn’t say we defined it differently. You seem to think that tolerance is a absolute virtue and I disagree. 
2.	My point here with the punch was that universal tolerance isn’t a virtue. People are intolerant of various things, physical violence being an obvious one. I think hateful words is something it’s okay to be intolerant of. Do I want to ban it? No. Do I want them hunted and murdered for sport? No. They have the right to say it, I have the right to be rude to them for saying it. I am not compelled to be tolerant of their intolerance. There is no moral obligation for me to respect their opinion when they have no respect for me and mine. 
3.	What’s abusive about telling people they’re going to hell isn’t the opinion itself, though I find it repugnant, but the way it’s used as a coercive threat and the hate behind it. Telling me I’m going to hell because I’m atheist or because I’m not straight or because I’m *whatever* and I’m going to hell for it and if only I do exactly as they say will I not burn in hell, that? That isn’t a friendly respectful opinion. Telling my friends they are going to hell because they’re Jewish is anti Semitic. Telling my friends they are going to hell because they’re Muslim is Islamaphobic. Telling my friends they’re going to hell because they have the audacity to be gay in public is homophobic. And if only... they stop it then you’ll stop hating them and start loving them and yadda yadda yadda. That’s abusive. 
4.	I never said I was some bastion of tolerance. That’s not a way I define myself. Am I tolerant? Sure. Just not universally so. I’m tolerant of many many ideas, but not all. I doubt neither are you. 

But further more I’m confused: why are you coming at me with so much vitriol? I’m saying that I do walk away.

As far as your anxiety when meeting people being “normal,” I’d say there’s no True “normal.” Being mentally healthy doesn’t mean never feeling anxiety, it means that when you do experience it, you’re still able to be productive and high functioning. Some people have very different “normals” than others. Some people are just naturally more anxious about meeting people than others and that’s okay! You’re also definitely not the only person to have a lot of fear or anxiety around meeting people. I promise that more people than you think face the same types of problems. 
As for “overcoming” anxiety, I can say with complete confidence that TONS of people have and it’s definitely an accomplishable thing. It’s just about how you define “overcome.” It might just be your nature to be more anxious than the average person and that’s totally ok. You may always have some level of anxiety around social interaction for the rest of your life. However, I know many personal friends of mine who have improved so much and have become much happier with their anxiety. 
I know it’s shitty but this isn’t a hopeless thing. This is an issue that’s not uncommon and has been helped time and time again. Having personally used the CMHC, I can vouch for it. I think it’s a great place to start.

trump isn't xenophobic either... his wife is from another country for gods sake...   


Im not trying to disagree with you, im trying to get you to understand clearly what i see from my point of view. this is exactly how trump wants you to see him. a racists guy who shouts a lot and is an idiot. But he could care less if you are black, white, iranian, russian, ect ect. if you are on his side, you are good people. if you are in his way, or disagree with him, you are a very bad person.   


Trump wants people running around saying hes racists because its one of the few things that are actually ""fake news"" about him. He's just a POS sell out who will do anything it takes to maintain the system that allows a person like him to bankrupt business after business without losing anything. He is the perfect representation of the cancerous capitalism that we need to get rid of and replace with a little democratic socialism.   


the more people that talk about how racists he is, the more people that forget or never even pay attention to the things i pointed out, which are the real problems.

mexico- cheap labor. the reason republicans do NOT want it to be easy to migrate from mexico is that a lot of companies rely on cheap mexican labor. Trump doesn't want all the people who work for a living to migrate to the US where they can make real wages. People such as trump want mexicans to stay in mexico as a way to cut labor costs. You think im joking, maybe? but ive met people IRL that have boasted to me that they made all of their money in the corporate world my exporting american jobs to mexico, saving millions in labor.   


He embraced the Islam ban in order to rile up his base. he could say he ""did something"". In the end though, he didn't ban muslims from entering the country outright. lets remember that the countries effected were: Libya, Syria, Iran, Yemen, Somalia, venezuala, and north korea. Most, if not all are in a state of conflict. At the end of the day. this was honestly done so he could say, ""i did that"". If trump was going to ban muslims, he would have honestly just done so. What trump did was poorly implement something designed to protect america, and at the end of the day it did more harm than good because of its poor implementation.   


and all of this completely takes away from the fact that hes gutted the EPA, built the keystone pipeline, and has done numerous other damaging things that we've all forgotten about.

Their stated strategy: ""Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke ""Afro-American racists"". Russia should ""introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, **encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts,** actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, **racist,** and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics""

13321,"I've no idea about Russian, but I'm currently enrolling into a third semester of a foreign language at UT. Like most courses, the language classes are quite the workload. In Korean and Japanese atleast (language courses I have knowledge of) have homework everyday, and require some extra studying. 

Is it worth it? Yes. If you genuinely have an interest in the foreign language's culture or just the linguistics of it, absolutely. Meeting everyday with the same people lets you make friends quite easily and I've found that I'm much more engaged in my language course.

頑張って！

EDIT: There are a couple of threads on the sub already but here are some previous responses:
&gt;Russian is a heavy workload (the course is a year of Russian in one semester, so 2 years in 1) but if you want to learn a language really well then I'd advise Russian, plus the professors are wonderful.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Foreign languages are amongst the hardest courses offered at UT. At 5 or 6 credit hours (can't remember which), they consume pretty much your entire week for one class. You meet every day, have tons of homework, and the majority of the class is not taught in english. Any language will be like this. If you like the idea of the rigor (you'll learn an incredible amount and actually be able to speak the language), no language is really easier than others.

13465,"Outside of mindfulness practice and CBT which have already been said here, I have found that the key to reducing the amount of anxiety is to be more conscientious in my daily routines and work. All of this entails to increase the amount of order in your life, which includes being aware of your own thoughts and being able to handle them in a constructive manner. Social anxiety, and any form of anxiety really, stems from the pattern of irrational negative thoughts that arise in one's mind. By practicing mindfulness and working on increasing your conscientiousness, you will be better equipped to deal with these thoughts.

The daily tenants that I try to follow to increase the order in my life are:

* Mindfulness practice (meditation)
* Getting consistent amounts of sleep (8 hours every night and going to bed and waking up at the same time every day)
* Eating the right amount of nutritious food (Avoiding refined carbohydrates and added sugars)
* Exercising
* Doing meaningful work every day

Start small, don't try to do everything at 100% intensity at once and then burn out and give up. Create easy and obtainable goals. Meditate for 3 minutes, exercise for 5 minutes, do 30 minutes of meaningful work, talk to one person in lecture that you haven't already. Once you have consistently achieved these goals, bump them up. Small, consistent incremental changes every day lead to large, substantial changes over a period of time.

The books that have helped me the most with my personal anxiety are Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, On the Shortness of Life by Seneca, and 12 Rules for Life by Jordan Peterson (He's somewhat of a controversial figure, but read it with an open mind).",0.4249,0.5252,0.0499

13501,"I started some minor prep for the GMAT last year (fall of my third year) and really started to take it seriously in early May of this year. I initially used the Manhattan prep books (10 books consisting of every topic covered on the test), but I found that I needed something a bit more structured to progress, so I signed up for an online Princeton review prep class. It was something like 10 classes over 6 weeks. I took the GMAT for the first time I think 3 days after my last class and got 640 which is good but not great (~68th percentile). That same day I signed up for another test a month later and got 690 (~85th percentile). I was extremely nervous and anxious the first time around, so I think a lot of the additional points came from me being more confident in myself and being more familiar with the test setting the second time. 

If you’re very disciplined and can reliably study for an hour or so a day, keep track of your progress, and set consistent goals, I would say to start off with the self-guided books.

This whole he's a racist thing is pushed in order to mask all of his shity policies as president. He's not a racist. He's a perfect representation of the type of corrupt entities that have been draining our country of its life for decades. 

You get the general public focused on a non important issue while the REAL issues are completely ignored. 

For example: companies have successfully push this narrative that carbon dioxide is what we have to worry about for climate change. but as far as greenhouse gases goes there are a lot of other ones that are being emitted which are far worse, like methane, which has being constantly ejected from natural gas Wells that have no way to store it so they just burn it. 

I honestly want to see you provide actual proof he's a racist. Muslim isn't a race, is a religion, and at the end of the day he didn't ban every Muslim from entering this country. If he had done that then he would have certainly been xenophobic. But he didn't. 

I just want to see some hard evidence that you have that he is a racist, because personally that's the one thing about him that's constantly said which is actually fake news. Just because he panders to the actual white nationalist who are actually racist doesn't make him racist by extension. It makes him like every other slimy politician with no morals.they will do anything and say anything to keep the people who vote for him voting for him.

If you withdraw or get booted there's a form you have to fill out I think.  By request I mean if you don't ask for it they aren't going to give it to you.  You'll just have a credit with UT until you do.  UT will find you for your debt but they aren't looking to give you your money back.

You can't get it back as a still active student from what I understand but if you made a stink I doubt they'd not refund it.  They aren't completely inflexible from my experience and it's generally such a small amount.  If a bunch of people tried that might be different.  The issue is that Bevo Bucks are sold to parents really not students.  They are promoting the idea that ""Hey!  Here's this account kinda like food stamps.  You put some money in there for your kids and they can only use it on necessities!  YEA! HooK-EM!""  If they just start handing over that money to students to spend willy-nilly there are going to be some pissed off parents who are/know lawyers.

13628,"You get it all back upon request.  UT only makes money off your $200 because they will accrue interest on the account that holds that $200 x however many students are enrolled in the program(or whatever the balance of that account is for any given month).  Technically you'd only be wasting the interest you would make by keeping the $200 in your bank account which is pretty much nothing.  There is no benefit to you unless a merchant decided to offer discounts for using Bevo Bucks.  I've never seen it happen and there is zero reason for them to do so.   

They are looking to make what your bank normally makes plus an extra 2-3% on average for every transaction plus the interest on the account/investment that holds all the funds.  Wouldn't be an issue if it were competitive with the banks, the equipment worked reliably and the agreement didn't preclude suing UT should their system screws over the business.  IMO it's questionably legal but since UT is the state and all the state legislature cares about wrt UT is how it can turn a profit there's not going to be any fighting it.  Since you aren't forced to live on campus or get a meal plan nobody can claim students are being forced to buy in to their state run bank and since vendors aren't forced to take it they can't really complain either.

BA degrees require completion of a foreign language plus more social science/humanities credits.

BSA is similar to a BA in that you need fewer math/science/major credits and more social science/humanities credits, but it does not require completion of a foreign language sequence. It also requires a transcript-recognized minor or certificate.

For most students wanting to go on to grad schools or to work in the field, a BS is probably best.

BA/BSA degrees are good if you have an interest in the field, but are also interested in a lot of other non-STEM areas. BA/BSA degrees are good if you are planning on going on to a professional school - law, medicine, library/information science, etc. Also, a lot of people get 1/2 - 3/4 through the degree and find they don't want to (or can't) do all the coursework for the BS.

Overall tough, swinging a second major is very difficult. Almost all of the classes are sequenced except about 5 or 6. Which works out to be a minimum 10 to 11 to 12 hours of classes each semester. This in joint with clinicals which are pretty much 3, 8 to 12 hour workdays each week, make doing anything else besides nursing school extremely difficult. 

You can do it, but  for the people I know it takes about two extra years. But those are double majors in the stem field. For something in the fine arts like music, there  will be pretty much no class overlap. So it will probably take longer. 

It is possible for nursing majors to get a (relatively small) certificate in something and still finish on time, but those people usually describe it as extremely stressful and difficult (myself included).

Also I want to note that if you are applying to UT in general, you have a marginally higher chance of getting into the nursing school.

13991,"To understand the difference between computer science and boot camps, it's important to first understand that computer science has a theoretical side and applied side, both with same ultimate goal: to find and build efficient computational systems and solutions to problems. People on both sides of the divide will occasionally sally forth to lob criticisms at each other. Theory people will accuse applied people of being glorified code monkeys and applied people will accuse theory people of being so concerned with proofs that they could not code their way out of a paper bag.

Theoretical or ""pure"" CS focuses on things like programming language theory (how to construct and classify languages), algorithmic proofs (how time and space efficient is this algorithm?), and theory of computation (what are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers?). At the extreme side, pure CS can be almost *anti* programming and its practitioners are mathematicians in all but name. Bjarne Stroustrup, creator of C++, once heard of a computer science professor who *bragged* about never having written a single line of code! Stroustrup, while appreciating the need for an understanding of theory, found this quite ridiculous and compared it to a piano teacher who had never played piano. Would *you* trust a PhD in music theory who had never played piano to teach you how to play it?

Applied CS is what most people are familiar with - the programs that you use on a daily basis, from your operating system to the UT registration website result from it. It's CS theory put into practice, a deceptively simple idea which rarely works perfectly. For example, theoretical CS can design (and then prove the efficiency of) an algorithm that finds the shortest path from point A to point B.  Applied CS then translates the algorithm's design into a programming language and then makes it available for public use via Google Maps (and even Google Maps gets it wrong sometimes). Applied CS requires knowledge of theory, but doesn't have to be as hardcore as pure theory. Coding is not in and of itself CS - it is just the tool that computer scientists happen to use to implement their ideas. As computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra put it, ""Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.""

Boot camps often focus solely on coding (almost always for web dev) because demand for that is high, and it's easy and fast to teach (in contrast to a 4 year degree, boot camps rarely last for more than half a year). Web dev is not CS, though the logistics of maintaining a website do intersect with actual CS, such as networks, distributed computing, and security. There is no time or desire to teach a specialized sub field like graphics, systems, or computer architecture, which require years of foundational knowledge and to be qualified to teach that, you'd probably need at least a Master's degree. Boot camps do not teach algorithms or automata theory. Better boot camps might introduce their students to the most basic applied parts of algorithms and data structures, making them at best equivalent to UT's CS 314 (Data Structures), but students would not have to do proofs as in CS 331 (Algorithms).

TL;DR

Computer science has a theoretical side and applied side, both with same ultimate goal: to find and build efficient computational systems and solutions to problems. Boot camps, to cut costs and save time, focus extremely narrowly on the applied parts of CS necessary for coding. Coding is not CS - it is a tool that computer scientists use. 4 year CS degrees provide much more breadth and rigor, and give their graduates a familiarity with theoretical CS that no boot camp will give. A good boot camp may train a decent entry level programmer, but to really be a computer scientist, you need to understand both theory and practice i.e. ""there should be no magic."" It's not enough to know what an array list is - you also need to know when it would be a good data structure to use. Even the most rigorous boot camps give an *extremely* limited understanding of applied CS at best.

Please reach out to me, or anyone else in our FIG if you need any help with studying, motivation, confidence, or anything of the sort. 

302 and 306 are both structured very different from high school courses, whereas 408D is structured more like a high school class, just more difficult. The change in structure is very difficult to adapt to, but I'm sure you'll do it eventually. If it helps any, Patt and Bank are the hardest professors you could have this year, and the fact that you're getting around the 25th percentile probably puts you very close to average out of all the professors.

My advice, is that UT is obviously very hard. If you like ECE, even if you aren't preforming well in the classes, you should stick with it. It's only your first year, and I'm sure it will only ever go up from here. If you signed up because of the high salaries, or because of parental pressure, maybe its not for you. 

One last thing I want to add, is that just studying won't help you, you need to make sure you're studying efficiently. I spent over 20x as much time studying for the first 302 exam compared to the second, (literally), and did better on the second, because I changed how I studied. After you finish the practice tests, spend lots of time reflecting on your mistakes, and try to understand why you made that mistake, and what you can do would do differently next time, to avoid that mistake.

What's important, and what you'll definitely learn by staying in ECE, is to not give up regardless of how bad things get. You got into this school and this major for a reason and if this is what you want, stick with it. I agree with the other comment that if you don't think you can take both you should consider dropping one and retaking the other in spring. There's no shame in doing that. My only regret is I took the GPA hit and still had to retake. Regardless, keep up the effort and you'll make it in the end. Hopefully your parents will understand that this is all a process and its only your first step. A couple of bad grades aren't the end of the world though. Stay strong bud.

Catalyst indicates that only 8.9% of Banks students failed 302 and I wasn't in the bottom 8% for the first exam, may have been for the second exam and the third exam is uncertain.

Isn't it too early to use OTE? That one-time is really biting me, what if I have a more urgent need later? 

I was thinking that if I can C-/C- 302 and 306, then I'll move on but if I end up with a D in 302, I'll take it at community college and I'll really study so I can pass Part A of Patt's final, scrape by with the C- and cry/decompress over the break.

If you were a citizen of Germany, perhaps the most successful democratic socialist country, you’d pay nothing for a quality college education. Only in the United States do you find this degree of absurd cruelty. Let’s call a spade a spade here, it’s the plutocracy in this country, via their puppets in government, that has put us in this position. It’s those folks who manipulate the system to our disadvantage. Having students pay a tax to benefit other students is bullshit, but it’s not socialism. It’s a cash grab by the elites.

14260,"Congrats! I'm currently a first semester freshman in ECE so I might be able to give some tips on some of the professors here.

1) You are in ECE, and can specialize in either your junior year.

2) Absolutely. I have ECE friends that work in CS jobs all the time, whether that be for internships or full-time. I already have first-hand experience of getting interviews and opportunities that are intended for CS students even when I am an ECE major. 

3) 302 is hard. Averages are low. Just study what you can, especially the old tests that they release. Be prepared to make much lower scores on tests than you are used to. I took Wasserman this semester for 302 and he tends to have the higher scores on most tests. For 306, if you know programming already, then don't get cocky. The LC3 is its own monster to tackle throughout the semester. The textbook by Yale Patt is the preferred one you should get, and if you are able to get Patt as your professor, then that would be best. He is hard but fair, and you will arguably learn a lot more in his section than with some of the other professors. Lastly, just be ready to work harder than you've ever worked before.

I worked my ass off and got an engineering degree at 32 years old because I wanted to live in a beautiful state and drive a nice truck.

# FAQ

## What does this mean?

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

## Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

* Rudeness towards other Redditors,
* Spreading incorrect information,
* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a `/s`.

## Am I banned from the Reddit?

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

## I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

## How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",0.0291,0.2726,0.6982

14276,"I'm in ECE but last semester I had failed a software design class, a required course in my major, with an F. I failed all my exams in that class. My GPA is now at 2.7 and I think that's a good reason I've been rejected by at least 30 different companies so far while applying to internships. Last semester was hard, I questioned everything, whether I want to sit down at a desk and work for the rest of my life, whether this major is right for me, whether the stress is worth working it out, etc.. But I think this semester I've made sure to join a club, make more friends, go to a bunch of UT events, go have fun like bowling and take naps and all, just taking care of myself mentally and emotionally. I think its paid of a lot in terms of how well I've been doing this semester. And now that I look at it, ECE is really hard, sometimes really stressful, and I really dont know what I will do with it in the future. But when I think about all the possible majors at UT, I feel happy to be in ECE, it feels to me like the best option out of them, so I know I'm in the right spot, it's just wiggling myself in there that's hard.

Coding games and apps is something a lot of CS peeps want to do but it's only possible during internships or research during academia time, or you make your own. That said, are the exams an indicator for how well you do in your major? Not necessarily. But it is important to try and do well. If you feel like you're withering away and wasting meaningful time of your life then youre burning out fast, and need to make time for the activities that rejuvenate you and make you feel like youre living your life. The problem with EE and CS at UT is they are notoriously hard and can burn out people really quick. The stereotype is that we dont do anything but work but if you keep doing that you're going to lose not because you arent capable but because you overestimated how much you can mentally and emotionally take. 

Now if there is something you really want to do I would encourage you to take steps toward it while giving ample focus and time to your major and your exams. You're still a freshman, and when I was going through what you're feeling I was a freshman too, but I'm a sophomore now, still in my major, and still doing fine so it is possible. 

Best of luck, and dont forget that being in a hard major shouldn't make you a robot, you still need to keep that humanity inside you.

EDIT: What a lot of peeps here are saying is amazing advice. What you can do with your major after you graduate can most definitely be worth going through a 4 years of hard work. See some of their experiences!",0.2982,0.4581,0.2437
14277,"That was my first reaction lol.

1. Yes, I can comfirm that Electrical Engineering is Electrical and Computer Engineering. That's just the way they abbreviate ECE (the computer aspect of it deserves more representation in the name in my opinion)

2. I've heard that you get nearly all the same opportunities as CS, but it all depends on the effort you put in!

3. For EE306 (introduction to computing) I recommend getting the book ""Introduction to Computing Systems Yale Patt and Sanjay Patel THIRD EDITION."" The course will be heavily based on that book (or at least it was for because I have Patt as a professor lol). For EE302 (introduction to Electrical Engineering), try to look at good professors (talking from experience :( ). Start looking at KCL, KVL, Node-Voltage method, and Mesh-Current method (in that order) on khan academy. Other than that just remember that failing is part of the process. It will be a lot of fun! 

Bonus tip: Try to have other activities other than just the curriculum of ECE (robotics club, job, or technological fraternity are good options). They are not only good destressers, but they will also help you develop time management skills (I am currently part of an honor fraternity and have a job. I am suffering, but know that I helped myself get ready for the future and managing my time).

(Granted, you won't be living in Austin, but moving out of Texas for a few years is a really good experience, especially if you grew up here or in Texas).

I personally recommend the Qualcomm and Microsoft internships. You may need to do some ""side work"" in school, like a part time coding gig, and or lots of open source.

14303,"Ok, I'm not a UT or CS student, but if I were in your shoes this is what I'd say to myself to get over this slump: 

1. CS is a major that is literally changing the world every day. This past morning I was watching a YouTube video over a car rental company similar to Airbnb called Toro. Headquartered in San Francisco, the software engineers of Toro are the bedrock of this company. We're in an age of start-ups where businesses formed by college students using programming are taking over the world. And it's not just in tech startups either, look at banks! Every single investment bank, hedge fund, and mutual fund I can think of has an app, AI-based trading methods in the works, and are slowly going to hire more people who can program and fewer people who are Finance majors. In developing countries where banks aren't available, many start-ups are being founded to provide microloans via the internet and this is where the world is heading. I promise you if this doesn't sound exciting than be happy you didn't choose another major. 
2. Coding is a hard skill that will get easier over time. Look, right now you're in your freshman year and I'm assuming you don't have an enormous amount of programming experience. There are plenty of people that are just like you and once you get over this hump you'll have a badge of honor to wear on your chest. I myself was recently admitted this past week into UT Austin's ECE department despite knowing nothing of programming.  I'm going to learn on my own, try my hardest, and keep my head up high because I know I'm studying a world-changing major. I've heard about the horrors of ECE, but I'm willing to put up with it and you should too. Take pride in your failures and the fact that you're studying a hard major at one of the best universities in the country. 
3. Find something you like to do outside of coding. Austin is one hell of a city, believe me. Any spare time you have should not be spent on regrets but on living in the present. Gather some friends and visit Greenbelt, go climbing at ABP, or just go to Pluckers and watch a game with friends on a weekend.

Honestly I think college gets harder as you push through the years. But you also just become better. You adapt and learn from your past mistakes, and with that, you grow a lot. I can’t say I’ve enjoyed most of my classes, but with every semester, j have more knowledge and more experience. 

Here’s the key though. You’re not here to be passionate about your courses and school. You’re here to be passionate about the opportunities and doors that open because of your degree. UT is a target school for tech and Austin is buzzing with new tech startups. Getting a CS degree here will give you so many internship opportunities(that you have to work to get into of course) and paths where you can discover what kind of company you actually want to work for and enjoy.

The biggest piece of advice I can give is to get to know the professors. Develop a relationship with them through conversation and going to office hours. Mike Scott kicked my ass so many times and I never seemed to get the grades I wanted no matter how hard I tried. But I got to know him after many office hours visits and it made things so much better. I was able to set aside some of the stress after I realized he wasn't out to get me.

Also I find that doing completely unrelated activities is good for reducing stress. Have you tried orgs, hackathons, side projects, or similar activities?

Also, although I think it's really important to try, there's an ideal medium between overstressing and being too casual when it comes to studies. On my first EE exam I studied a ton, I knew the material, and there was no reason I couldn't have done great, but I stressed so hard that I shut down at the exam and got like a 40.

14353,"Hey! I graduated this May, and I felt like this ALL. THE. TIME. I had many breakdowns crying about whether I was doing the right thing and if I majorly fucked up. 

Here’s what I will tell you, it got easier every semester. Right now, you are a freshman and everything’s overwhelming. On top of that, this is a difficult course load!! Don’t let anyone tell you it’s not. It was one of my toughest semesters at UT, taking those two classes. 

I will tell you that I am out of college and I am now a software engineer at a company that’s helping people with disabilities, which is what I’m truly passionate about, not CS, and I have never been so happy in my life. It gets better. 

Here’s my advice: 

1) Take a deep breath. Think about how you felt about CS a month ago. You’re coming to the end of the semester and it’s stressful and exhausting so it’s easy to talk yourself out of your major. Don’t make any decisions in that mind frame.

2) Think about the future. What do you want to do after college? How is this degree furthering your plans? You mentioned wanting to make games. Checkout the game dev capstone. When can you start that? Figure out a semester and look forward to it. How are you going to find meaning and satisfaction in a career involving CS? How will this degree help you get there? Is there any way to adapt your degree plan (BS, BA, BSA) in a way that will help you survive and accomplish your goals? 

3) DON’T compare yourself with your fellow students. In my experience, a lot of CS students lie. The personality CS attracts tends to be one of a lot of pride. People don’t like to admit when they are wrong or need help. They will talk themselves up about offers and grades. They don’t matter. Only you do. 

4) All you can do is your best. Try your hardest, without forsaking your mental or physical health. Reach out for help and advice from TAs and your professors. Don’t think so much about the grades, but think about accomplishing what you can.",0.3345,0.4333,0.2322

So, if my TDEE is 2000, I can eat 1500 a day to lose a pound a week. A pound is equivalent to 3500 calories, so -500 a day will get you to that pound. The recommended weight loss amount is 1-2 lbs a week, or 4-8 a month.

I agree with what /u/LiluSama said - 210 is a pretty difficult class to do well in and it's completely normal to struggle a bit in it. I also don't think 210 is necessarily representative of all of the chemical engineering classes; personally, I hated it so much that I nearly transferred to EE, but I really love being in chemical engineering right now.

Since chemical engineering is so diverse, the classes cover a really wide range of topics. As a result, some people complain that our classes are too theoretical/have too much pure science or math, while others find the more industry-related classes boring or uninteresting since they want to go straight to grad school. You probably won't like every class, but I think there's a niche for everyone in the degree plan.

Beyond classes, be as involved as possible! It made a world of a difference to me. Check out AIChE and the Undergraduate Advisory Board in particular for something chemE-related, and I definitely recommend doing outside of chemical engineering to have fun/stay in shape.

Jester is the party dorm and where most people (including most of my friends) lived. sink in your room.

Apartments:

Signature 1909 (formerly Aspen Heights) ($1200/month for a 4x4) (fully furnished) - PLEASE DONT LIVE HERE. Overpriced for what it is, metric fuck ton of problems - bad water pressure, non-working wifi, constantly breaking appliances, small rooms, slow maintenance responses,  random fees when you move out etc.  Also random fire alarms at 3 am.

Crest at Pearl ($1030/month for a 4x4) (furnished but No TV) - spacious rooms and closets, especially if you get the corner rooms in a 4x4. Relatively fast maintenance responses, decent appliances. Thermostat was a bit wonky when we first moved in but got fixed relatively fast. Elevators are REALLY slow but at least there are only 6 floors. Wifi occasionally spotty. Overall pretty ok 

I have lived those two apartments\^\^ but I have friends that have lived in the following so I can provide some input:

The Nine (furnished) - One of the nicer places in west campus, decently sized rooms, small asf closet, nice lobby area. Pretty close to campus

Muze (furnished) - Your own room isn't really your own room since the doorframes don't have doors. My friend had to put curtains up to ""separate"" his room from his roommate's. Shared bathrooms and closets smaller than dorm closets lol. Nice lobby area and lounge/rooftop. Very close to campus.

Skyloft (furnished) - less shitty version of Signature 1909. Rooms I've been to have pretty small common areas. Nice lobby. Apparently some rooms have concrete pillars in the middle of the living room.

26 West (furnished? I don't think it comes with a TV?) - One of the better west campus apartments if you want to be close to engineering. The 4x4 room layout is similar to Crest at Pearl.

21 Rio (unfurnished) - One of the more expensive places in west campus (I think its around $1300 for a 4x4). Rooms are pretty spacious. Pretty close to campus.

Quarters Nueces (unfurnished?) - Party apartment. Loud as fuck on the weekends. Pretty close to campus. Parking is expensive but convenient. 

Quarters Grayson (unfurnished) - Toned down version of Quarters Nueces. Bathrooms have 2 sinks and they're kinda big. 

Quarters Sterling - Toned down version of Quarters Grayson

Your first semester in ChemE and its difficulty relies entirely on what classes you choose to take. I would personally advise that you make the courseload a little easier so you can adjust better. Your first ChemE specific class will be 210 and to be honest, it's kicking a lot of people's butts. If you take 210, be kind to yourself and know that the class is just dummy hard. It's easy to get discouraged when you don't get the grades that you want, but you should know that everyone else is also struggling.

The key is to actually meet each week and to avoid doing it over the internet via Skype or what not.  It works.  Keep the size limited to 5 people.  We met each week in the same room in one of the libraries.  Do not meet up at anyone’s home, or dorm room, too many distractions in people’s homes.  Make sure all cell phones are OFF.  Meet for an hour and half more or less as the group needs.  Plus, as a group you can visit the professor during his office hours occasionally throughout the semester, at least once.  You can be the coordinator of the group.  Do this each semester and you will make tons of friends and might even get great grades.  
Do you live in dorm?  If doing laundry you can take someone’s laundry out of the dryer before they return and FOLD it for them before they return.  Throw your laundry in the dryer immediately prior to folding theirs.  (Your laundry doesn’t need to be even wet or even a lot of clothes.  They won’t notice.). If they don’t return while you are folding, leave a post it note or a scratch piece of paper on their laundry with your number on it.  Put a happy face on the note, and something like:  (I hope u don’t mind).  You can do this over and over and over throughout the semester.  You will make a lot of friends and the odds are some will have common interests as you.  
Be bold: I used to eat several times week in dorm cafeterias, Jester, Kinsolving, etc.  I was NOT there to eat, I was there to meet new people.  I would take my tray over to someone’s table and just right out ask them  if this  seat is taken, or even more directly ask them, “hey, do you mind if I join you?

Ask and talk about the food, weather, and which dorm has the best food, do not ask anything about them, UNLESS they ask you first, about yourself or your major etc.  if they start the ball rolling with personal questions you can ask for their number when you get up to leave, or invite them to meet again for another meal.  I often was not even hungry. I just wanted to meet someone new.  You have to eat sometime and somewhere anyway.  Might as well make new friends at the same time.  People are often in a hurry at lunch time, and tend to linger over their meals longer at dinner.  Do this at least 4 times a week.  If money is tight just get a cup of coffee or whatever else is inexpensive.  Even if you aren’t a coffee drinker, you can still buy a cup, you don’t have to drink it. 
Be bold, if you see someone who is attractive to you, just tell them upfront, say, “I couldn’t help but notice you eating alone and how attractive you are I just wanted to meet you, would it be ok if I joined you, or are you waiting for someone?”    Be sure to ask for permission to join them.  They will stay and talk with you if they have any interest in you, or they will leave as soon as they finish if you are not their cup of tea.  

Buy a old non working phone off eBay.  Use a label maker and put your actual phone number on it,  Sit near someone you want to meet, briefly, sit, and accidentally leave the phone on the table when you leave.  You are likely to get a text or call from them.  These broken phones a few bucks each.  I used to buy 5 at a time and always carried one with me.  Also works on the shuttle buses, class, gym machines, and my personal favorite location, the library. Be proactive, be bold.  Everyone likes making new friends.  You lack of friends is Temporary situation, years from now you will have many from college and they will continue on for decades. Be bold. 
Several times a semester there are dances in the student union.  Go to them.  People are there to meet other people.  
Pick a church and go each week.  Ask if the seat is taken before you sit down beside someone you want to meet.  This gives you the opportunity to be beside a stranger for a longer time than just a fast lunch.  Leave your phone and leave first,   Good luck to you, you got this!",0.4942,0.463,0.0428

I’m finding that very few people really want to make friends with someone their mom’s age, and while I don’t blame them, it’s pretty isolating. I’m probably “closer” to making friends with my professors, but they’re grading me, so that’s off-limits. 

Add to that the fact that it’s my first time back in school in 15 years, so while I’m technically a senior, I’m really fucking rusty. Everyone else has been doing academic work and writing papers for the last 3 years, but I haven’t. I’m having to reawaken those skills at the senior level and I’m struggling!
