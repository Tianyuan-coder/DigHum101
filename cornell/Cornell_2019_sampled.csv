I realize the program is *extremely* competitive, and that there are more qualified candidates than the department can accept.

GPA vs research experience?), and are there any hard cut-offs that would keep an application from even being reviewed?

Oats, milk, eggs, rice, beans, big trays of chicken, whatever vegetables and fruits are in season fresh, whatever canned produce is cheap.

1) For the required workshop, plenty are offered every semester. You are required to attend one the semester before you leave, so keep that in mind your fall semester sophomore year if you want to travel in the spring. 

2) For the language requirement, it depends on the program as others have mentioned. I studied at Wageningen University in the Netherlands which is a pure life science university with no humanities. As such, there were no Dutch courses offered, so the requirement to take a course in the language there was waived. As the courses are taught in English, I did not have to take a language course prior to leaving as well. It would be useful (and courteous) to have some working knowledge of the language prior to leaving, but it certainly is not required in places that speak English impeccably well such as the Netherlands. 

3) As for my experience, I loved it! It is certainly one of those things you will look back on and treasure due to just how unique of an opportunity it is. I’m glad you’re enthusiast about traveling, and I would recommend once you get established this fall and choose an advisor to sit down and discuss abroad options.

317,"1. It's usually a good idea to apply for multiple project teams. Applications for project teams can be very competitive; if you apply to only one team you have more of a risk of not joining a team. (I checked our numbers out of curiosity; our acceptance rate was around 20% last fall, with five times more freshmen applicants than non-freshmen applicants. No comment on yield, lol.) Project teams are pretty popular. There were over 1,100 students in all of the project teams as of last semester.

2. In the *vast* majority of cases, people only do one project team. Doing multiple is rare, and a recipe for a ton of stress. Is it possible? It certainly depends on the project teams. The weekly commitment from a project team varies all over the place; maybe if someone picked two that are *very little* work they could pull it off. It's very difficult to balance the commitment, though. (I speak from experience. 2/10 would not recommend)

I think eventually this would change the culture of Cornell and allow people to focus on extracurriculars they enjoy. Of course, there will still be competition, but not making it into the top project team and instead, finding another opportunity to code is nowhere near as devastating as failing a class. The mental health of Cornell's students is more important than the reputation of its students. Additionally, if Cornell grew out of being known for depression, it would attract more students and lower its acceptance rate, improving its standing among other colleges. Besides, many clubs and organizations teach skills that are more important in students' careers than the ability to get good grades.

443,"I guess my verdict is: high-quality shitpost. Good quality trolling overall and admirable emulation of a high school student with little formal training seeking to get into theoretical physics. The unintentional-seeming arrogance really helps sell the idea too. But, there are a few flaws preventing you from getting the coveted 10/10 shitpost:   
1\. Someone interested in theoretical physics of this nature would be doubling in physics and math, or tripling in all three majors, rather than minoring in CS. However, perhaps the student is unsure of his path, and wants to leave CS as a backup option.   
2\. It is hard to believe that a freshman with substantive knowledge of high-level theoretical physics would be unable to google simple questions like these. On the other hand, it has become clear that this year's freshmen have extremely limited googling capabilities as a whole, so not necessarily a dealbreaker.   
3\. It's unclear what it means to do research in special relativity in the year 2019. This is, however, believable if we are assuming a student with only cursory knowledge of the fields and their development.  
4\. The dealbreaker. It is inconceivable that a student of physics, theoretical physics no less, would engage in calling themselves a ""STEM freshman"", associating their studies with such unsavory fields as engineering and even information science.

From personal experience, I tried talking to a couple of physics professors freshman year and it didn't really go anywhere, mostly because I wasn't persistent enough. (And because I was a freshman. There's (apparently?) a physics professor meme that freshmen don't really know stuff - for research - unless they have a serious background outside of the coursework.

That being said I would be extremely cautious and methodical about preparing for this test. The Cornell Latin program varies substantially from your typical ""average"" college, and I found that they teach a form of ecclesiastical latin that is symbolically irregular and vastly different from the more standard spoken/written Latin (Standard) spoken and studied by most. 

To prepare I would recommend familiarizing yourself with the various forms of irregular declensions found in the preterite and pluperfect tenses, and the myriad of scientific compound words littered throughout the medical and anthropological fields.

* Initially Duo had so many connectivity issues. You would request a login key and it wouldn't come for like 5 minutes, and you'd request another one just for that to trigger the first one.
* Student Center itself is a broken fuck, so when you sign in and get that weird HP login failed screen and you would just fix it by hitting 'back' and it would take your student center profile, Duo fucks you over by being in the way.

558,"Not an engineer, but I am a stem Cornell student.  My older sister and friends are in COE. To be honest some of your hardest classes (to get As on) will be in your freshman year. The classes are usually designed so that most of the average level students will get a B- (2.9). They do this by placing your classes score on the bell curve and then setting the mean of the curve to a B-. This also means to get above the mean you will have to score better than your classmates, and for an A you will have to score exceptionally well on your exams and projects.

I’m a rising senior and I think college grades are less about being some genius kid in lecture and more about just being smart about prioritizing well. There are so many freshman engineers who do bad from the start because they made a hard schedule. At the end of the day a person with only 1 exam for that week can do significantly better than someone with 4 exams for that week. Also it’s important to learn how to study and stay on top of your work. College students procrastinate and stress out unnecessarily because they are reluctant to do their work. All in all, for most people I know our freshman grades are our lowest. It’s easy to figure out where you went wrong after your first 2 exam periods. It’s so much better to see your grades improve as you become simply better at being a college student. Lastly, every student at Cornell will have very few weekends where their workload is virtually nonexistent (usually after a hellish exam week). Use those weekends to enjoy yourself and destress before your other exams. Also, try not to skip class your first year. If you’re the type that would benefit from showing up to class, it can be very stressful to study knowing that you skipped 3 weeks of class.

Aside from the occasional “elite” company like NASA which might want a 3.5 gpa, companies will not care about a GPA as long as it is over 3, and even a 2.9 will be okay. Don’t be too worried about your gpa, as long as you do all your work and study hard come exam time you will be fine, and I'm sure you will still have time to have some fun on the weekends.

&amp;#x200B;

As for auditioning... We have a few different orchestras, chamber, symphony, and open. Auditioning itself was okay. But I guess as a cello, I had slightly less competition. I think there were 27? cellos that applied last fall and 24 or 25 got in (altogether in symphony and chamber).

Chamber was an absolute mess last year, with a lot of big administrative issues, and I really overall had an awful time. (The people were GREAT though!) As also an engineering student, i found that I was really bad at managing my time, and the chamber rehearsals were always late in the day, which meant on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I had class from 9 am until 4:15, and then rehearsal from 4 45 to 7:15/30.  And was expected to be there by 4:30. So it essentially made my Tuesdays and Thursdays really bad. Another thing to keep in mind is that most prelims are Tuesday and Thursday nights at 7:30 PM. So if you are a crammer, you can't really miss rehearsal (i mean you /can/ but its not recommended and might hurt your grade)

Symphony I heard was really great, and the rehs are on the same schedule but on Mon/Wed. The only thing is that Chamber is so much smaller and felt more intimate and you got to know more people and make more friends. I can't speak for my friends in symphony but being friends with every single person you're playing with feels a lot harder when theres like 60 of them lol

I dont really know anything about the open one, just that it exists and doesnt cut anyone. But could be good for playing just once in a while.

You also have the option of smaller chamber groups, like quartets and stuff, as well as private lessons. You just have to reach out to the music department profs/teachers.

648,"Depends what you're looking for in terms of ""athlete"". Are you looking at what they did at Cornell, or after? Does fame of being in a more noted sport count more? Since Dryden, Nieuwendyk, and Dake have all been mentioned here, I'll throw out a couple more contenders (Marinaro was also mentioned in the Quora thread):

Ed Marinaro ([Football, 1969-1971](https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/ed-marinaro-1.html)):

* First running back in NCAA history to run for 4,000 career rushing yards.
* Led the nation in rushing in both 1970 and 1971. 
* Runner-Up to Pat Sullivan for the Heisman Trophy in 1971.
* Won the 1971 Maxwell Award and the UPI College Football Player of the Year as the top player in college football.
* Set 16 NCAA records, and still holds two NCAA records: most rushes per game in a season (39.6 in 1971) and career average carries per game (34.0, 1969–71). 

[Rob Pannell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pannell) (Lacrosse 2009-2013):

* Fourth leading scorer in men's Division I history
* Holds the Cornell and Ivy League all-time scoring records. 
* NCAA's Outstanding Player of the Year in Men's Lacrosse in both 2011 and 2013. 
* Won the 2013 Tewaaraton Trophy, the most outstanding American college lacrosse player. 

If you expand out from athletic feats, and include post-Cornell coaching careers:

* [Pop Warner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_Warner) (Football 1892-1894): Yes, this is the Pop Warner that ""Pop Warner"" football is named after. Not necessarily the most athletically significant, but is a coaching legend who is responsible for a lot of how football looks today. 
* [Bruce Arena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Arena) (Soccer, 1972-1973): Again, largely known for coaching career after Cornell, including stints as USA men's national team coach. Was the goalie of the 1972 soccer team that reached the national semifinals.",0.2211,0.7536,0.0254

Most people viewed this as desirable but I personally didn't like it. Classes are my excuse to get up in the morning, so I wasted a lot of time MWF because I would not go to campus unless I had some other obligation, which was usually in the afternoon. It messed with my sleep schedule because I had nothing in the morning MWFSSu but had to wake up early T/TH, so I was late a lot.  T/TH was also draining, and I found it difficult to do anything that wasn't related to classes on those days, as I had at most a 20 minute break during normal ""working"" hours.  If you are very organized and good at time management, as well as able to find motivation to go to campus to work/study every day, then this may work well, but I personally needed more structure and am bad at managing time on my own.

The flexibility may be useful in cases where you really need additional time to finish something, study, or just catch up on sleep. You can also travel on Friday and come back Monday if you have the means/free time, but I was rarely able to do this.

However, doing this schedule was the only way I could take all the classes I wanted, and in my opinion it's not worth sacrificing classes for an ""optimal"" schedule (unless you can easily swap classes between semesters).

698,"Hi there! Great job on those AP scores! I definitely agree that you're not necessarily above or below average in terms of your profile, which is completely okay. I definitely encourage you to visit if you're truly serious about coming to Cornell. If money is the issue, then considering taking a bus to NYC overnight and renting a car from an airport car rental (if you're on the east coast, there should be one if you dig online) assuming that your parents are willing. I've bussed from Atlanta to NYC or Chicago numerous times without any problem. If your parents can afford it/if you're willing to take out loans if you get into Cornell, then ED definitely improves your chances.

A couple points on your application, definitely get those essays into good shape. I maintain the belief that my essays are what got me in. Those dates really sneak up on you, so make sure you're budgeting your time and factoring in how much time you'll need to work on college and scholarship applications. Also, with your Psych teacher, even if he's super forgetful, just check up on him to make sure he's getting it done. Also make sure to thank him, because those recs can take upwards of 30 min, which is time that he's taking out of his day to help you individually.

Lastly, I'm honestly not familiar with Overwatch, but I feel like the tournaments and awards listed don't necessarily belong on a college application. I don't know what admission's impression of gamers is, but for the most part, I feel like the safer bet is to not include it because it takes up space that can be used for any other awards that you've received. Alongside that, AP Scholar, w distinction, etc. don't belong in the awards part of your common app- again admissions can calculate themselves, or if you send in your APs (I would, looking at your scores thus far), it should be listed.

I have found that I design my schedule to leave 3 blocks of time that are 3-4 hours throughout the week to work 9-10 hours.

I’m really interested in attending Cornell University’s SHA.

I would like to pursue a Master’s in Management of Hospitality or Master in Science of Hotel Administration which I can continue with a PhD.

I will be coming from the Philippines so I need to take an English proficiency exam. Is there a way to waive this? 

I haven’t taken a GRE yet so I can’t do a “chance” me post. I am planning to take the exam in November or December this year.

I graduated last 2017 as a Magna Cum Laude of my batch with a degree in International Travel Management. I spent a year working in a ski resort and a hotel in Michigan.

What can I add to my experiences to better my chances of admission in the future if I’m not yet qualified now? And what GRE score should I aim for? 

Thank you so much! Any help will be appreciated. And if there’s someone I can talk to through messages, it’ll be an honor.",0.6128,0.3536,0.0336

900,"Yes!! I joined the piano studio last semester.

It was wonderful. You will audition to join a group under the current PhD student who is teaching that semester (last was Theodora Serbanescu-Martin, she was excellent you can look her up). The audition is 2 songs, they won’t make you play a lot they just wanna see your competence in 2 different styles.

Keep in mind however (because I didn’t exactly realize this), this is not really ‘lessons’ like you’d get after school on Tuesdays in high school each week. It’s not designed to teach beginners, but more for already skilled pianists with experience. 

If you get in, this comes with weekly lessons with the teacher, biweekly piano classes (they’re long lectures with some playing, 2 hours usually) and an end of semester concert.

Like I said the studio is not for beginners which they make clear on their website. I was one of 10 students, all of which were varying levels. I have been playing classical piano for 13 years and I would say I was around ranked around 6-7 (10 being the best person there). I was also among the youngest as a freshman, with a lot of juniors and when a grad student. 

For example of the level, I was playing Chopin Ballade 1, Clara Schumann romances op. 11. Other students were playing Liszt’s Un Sospiro, Liszt-Schumann’s Widmung, Chopin’s Ballade 2. Right now I’m learning some Mephisto Waltz no. 1 and 3, and some Fledermaus Grunfeld, both are destroying me lol. 

The instruction is at a very high level. Even with my experience, I definitely felt a little small lol. But that may have just been Theodora’s style. She’s very bold and witty, and a bit scary, and VERY skillful, I’m sure she will become a world class pianist one day. So that made her a bit scary to learn from. This is a good thing btw, it means you’re really learning from a real virtuoso. keep in mind tho she’s no longer teaching, a new PhD comes each semester

I’d say 4-5 years of classical piano is around the lower limit for what’s necessary. Do it if you really want to enhance yourself as a musician, which is great if you do. 

Please don’t let any of this scare you, and remember if you don’t feel inspired and amazed, and a bit shitty at the end of a lesson that means it’s not intense enough. The best way to know if you’re good enough is to audition. If you need any other info PM me",0.4856,0.4106,0.1038

I want to know what brands/types of winter apparel I need to get to survive the winter. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life, so I’ve never seen snow and haven’t truly experienced a real winter. I’m planning on buying a winter coat at Burlington’s when I get over there, some gloves, and I checked a subreddit talking about winter boots and they made me think buying boots is more complicated than I originally thought. Now I wonder how much research I need to put in to getting the proper gear. I’ve got a couple beanies and long pants already.

A second question I’ve wondered is how much will we really be in the snow walking to classes. I know that some buildings do connect each other and freshman have unlimited bus fare, but when that is all accounted for, I want to know how much do we walk in frigid weather.

- no. Personally I don’t party a ton, not as much my style, but I know plenty of people (including engineers and people who definitely have tough coursework) who do. I spend more of my time climbing or doing outdoor activities, but whatever you’re up to, there’s definitely time for a social life as long as you manage it well.

1018,"Hey guys, I'm considering ED'ing to Cornell as a math major, but I'm worried that I won't have enough time to balance my social life and academic courses, so I wanted to ask a few questions to any current math majors at Cornell:

* How taxing is your schedule? Do you have to put in insane amounts of effort just to keep up?
* Would you say that because of your course you find yourself extremely restricted in terms of social events? ( I don't mean like missing a couple of parties or whatever, because I now that sometimes sacrifices must be made, but if you find yourself seriously cut off please let me know.)
* How smart would you say you were in high school? ( I'm not anything exceptional, like I'm no state champion or anything but I am well above average, I'd say top 5%)
* What is the environment like at Cornell? I don't want to end up going to a school that's filled with prep school kids all of one background.

1039,"I’m assuming you’re not a student a Cornell?

If you’re not:
- most universities have a graduate school counselor and possible one for your exact major. That would be a much better place to start.
- research experience and your publications are a great asset. There is a big difference between someone who can do good research and someone who can get good grades. Make that clear as day in your application and admissions officers and possible advisors will see that and be impressed.
- 3.3 is definitely a bit on the lower side, but still good, so just make sure you shine in any essays, recommendations, GREs you do.
- Cornell’s graduate school counselors are also possibly a resource. The CS department has a few and I’m sure you could send them an email to learn more! Don’t be afraid to reach out to them.

If you are a Cornell student:
- its generally advised that you don’t get a PhD at the same place you do your bachelors (with exceptions)
- if you are still dead set on Cornell, talk to our CS graduate counselors. Often times they push you in the direction of doing an MS there first before doing a PhD if you’re a student here, but if you have good research experience then jumping straight to the PhD is a fine idea.

Regardless:
- where you go for your PhD is important, but also not. I’ve heard many stories of people going to places like Stanford and even MIT and being neglected by their advisors who are running companies in their off school time. So sometimes smaller schools are the way to go.
- doing good research and finding fuel for your interests is most important, so make sure you know of an advisor and of work that would make that possible. If you have certain professors that pique your interest, send them an email and learn more about what they’re working on or what they want to work on.
- Cornell is particularly amazing for theory, systems and programming languages. While you could do good research anywhere, if you’re not interested in those fields of CS definitely consider some other schools as well.

&gt;I generally found a mid/ankle height waterproof boot to be more than enough. For reference I wore my hiking boots ([these](https://www.backcountry.com/the-north-face-hedgehog-fastpack-mid-gtx-hiking-boot-mens)) most of the winter. Cornell clears the sidewalks around campus pretty quickly and pretty well, so generally you won't have to deal with more than a couple inches of accumulation or some slush if you're just walking around campus. If you plan on doing some winter sports or hiking or whatever that'll have you pushing through deep snow, that's another story, but for just around campus you don't need too much.

Other random thoughts, and feel free to ask questions if I can clarify at all. you will definitely be walking outside, no question about it. Personally I walked to class pretty much every day unless I was really late, as the busses got full, and I enjoy the outdoors. Agreed that you do not need a Canada Goose, but I would definitely spend a little bit of money for a decent quality winter coat than just getting the cheapest off the rack. There are lots of good options that don't get in to the $1000 range.  Most of the brands I would come up with off the top of my head are more outdoor sports focused (not the all-in-one type thing most people would wear around campus), but if you're really struggling to even get a start on where to look, I'm sure people here could give some ideas. In general, you want to dress in layers in the winter. So unless you actually get a Canada Goose, you're probably going to want some sweaters/light jackets/etc to wear underneath a big winter coat.

1132,"honestly think my chances are low but making this post anyway just to see others opinions. I am a caucasian female hoping to pursue a chemistry major at Cornell. 

Grades:
SAT: 1380 (690 in Math, 690 in English) - planning to take one more time to bump it up a little if I can find the time. If not, I’m also looking into taking an ACT (shooting for 31 or above). 
SAT Subject Tests: planning to take Chemistry and Physics
GPA: weighted around 99 (we dont know officially until this coming fall). 
Rank: we find out in fall, but I am fairly confident that I am in the top 25 of my class (10-15%)
APs: Biology (3), Language and Composition (4), US History (3), Environmental Sciences (4), taking AP Calc AB and AP Chemistry

Recommendation Letters: 
planning to give to Global History teacher- I was the top student in his class by far and I do volunteer work for him, including organizing and executing a charity race at a local farm. He also offered me a tutoring job on the clarinet, which I have done for 2 years now. 
I’m also planning to get a letter from my band teacher, who has always admitted to seeing me as a highly-valued student with great talent and work ethic, I have been in his advanced wind ensemble for two years and plan to perform in the pit of the school musical this year. 

Honor Societies:
National Honor Society
French Honor Society
Tri-M Honor Society (music honor society)

Others:
I play school volleyball, JV for 2 years and Varsity for 2 years. Planning to run for a spot as team captain this year. 

I have scored mastery on all of my regents exams, so I will obtain a mastery regents diploma for Math and Science. 

I’m joining the school’s Science Olympiad team, preferably competing in a chemistry lab competition. 
 
I devote a large portion of my time to my class, through volunteering to help out with homecoming skits by building props and organizing the skit, by creating decorations and decorating our hallways for the holidays, through hours of set-up for Junior Prom, and by taking a leader role in preparing our grade for Class Competition. 

I am hoping to participate in an All County Band this year, which would be my second year playing in it. I also have played in the NYSSMA music festival for 3 years and received a 97/100 or above each time. 

I’ve completed over 100 hours of community service throughout my high school career:
-Running and assisting with middle school volleyball tryouts for 3 years
-Competing in a charity volleyball marathon at the high school for 2 years
-Organizing and executing a charity race at a farm nearby
-Counseling a sports camp at my high school for 2 years
-Tutoring an underclassman in Algebra 2 during my lunch period for 1 year
-Participating in an Awareness Walk for Type I Diabetes

Job Experience:
-I have been employed at Ralph’s Italian Ices since April 2019
-I tutor a younger student on the clarinet, I have done this for a period of around 10 weeks for 2 years so far.

People are giving you brazen responses because it seems you're not actually interested or curious in what other people are doing - you are comparing yourself to them. This is evident in the, ""I feel terrible because I didn't have an internship, [did you guys have internships? What about my recruiting prospects?]""

Nobody likes the guy/girl constantly sizing their academic/job prospects up to others. If you actually are just interested in what people have done you really, really need to work on phrasing. 

_________________

As to internships freshman year: nobody is giving real internships to freshman besides diversity/educational outreach programs (Google Explore, Facebook University, etc.) because freshman are both stupid and lacking experience (unless you've self-studied/side project'd a ton). On top of that, an internships primary function is vetting potential new-grad hires - nobody is going to put you through a hiring pipeline when you have at minimum three years of schooling left.

1225,"You can’t go wrong with Uggs. I lived in Uggs during college and still live in them now. If you have never had a pair the fur Lining will keep your feet comfier than they have ever been. If you do get Uggs a few pieces of advice I can offer is 

1. For sizing when you first put them on they should feel very snug but not feel uncomfortable at first and they will stretch and the fur inside will mold to your foot after a week giving you a perfect fit. 

2. If you want to get the most out of your Uggs they are meant to be worn barefoot. This might seem weird and you would think that they will smell quickly but because of the sheepskin they will get your feet from getting to hot or to cold from -30 to 80 so your feet won’t sweat in them so no smell. If they do sweat a little sheepskin is very breathable and it is antimicrobial. If you wear socks your feet will be colder and you won’t be able to feel the soft fur. Socks will also make them not fit as nice and they will ware out faster. I have been wearing Uggs for over ten years and have never worn socks with them and mine have 
never smelled, same with my friends and sister. 

3. I have heard people say they don’t work good as winter boots because they slip easy. I can tell you that this in not True you will only slip in them if you are on full ice which is the same as any shoe. Campus is always kept salted and free of ice so they are perfect. Also people say they get wet in the snow. I can tell you this is not True all my years of wearing them my feet have never got wet in them even walking in a foot of snow. The new ones are even better they come treated to repel water. Depending on the color you get they might look wet on the outside but your feet will be warm and dry in them and the surface will dry quickly and look brand new after.

Ugg boots are a great piece of foot ware. The reasons people don’t like them is either looks. Which if you are going to class who care what you look like it’s much better to be comfy so you can focus better. or they wear socks with them and are not comfy. The first time you put them on without socks your brain will tell you this is not normal. Then you slide them on and feel your foot surrounded by the soft fur and it will feel amazing then you go to leave in them and you think this can’t be ok my feet will get blisters and smell. But as you are walking to class or the store     At first all you are thinking about it how nice your feet feel then the thought fades and you are out and about all day not thinking about it and when you get home you go to take the boots off and you remember that you do have socks on in them and you remember how comfy your feet were all day. You feel your feet and they are not wet from sweat and you smell inside the boot and it smells brand new. The next day is the same but after a week you don’t even think about it. 

Sorry for how long this is but all I can say is get Uggs you can’t go wrong. Your feet will be in heaven.",0.382,0.4591,0.1589

If your goal is to finish the physics major, know that it's possible to finish even starting 1116 in the spring. It'll be tighter, for sure, but it's still doable, if that's your concern. Otherwise, if you want to take Physics in the fall (and to be clear, there are legitimate reasons for wanting to do so, such as meeting all the other physics majors early, most of whom will also be taking 1116 in the fall), you'll need to consider dropping one of the three.

EDIT: One more thing. If you're comparatively least passionate about CS but still don't want to miss out on the experience of the honors class, you could always take 2112 sophomore fall. I know of one other person who did that. You can just find another class to fill your credit requirement (maybe a distribution requirement, or just something that sounds fun - your schedule will get plenty busy later, so enjoy yourself freshman year).",0.5904,0.378,0.0316

It’s definitely helpful to hear about the professor changes, because I’ve heard that it affects the difficulty a lot but I don’t know much about each professor. The only problem I have with that suggestion is that right now I’m more interested in physics than the other two (CS is probably the one I’m least interested in right now). Because of that I’d really like to take 1116 first semester so I can move on to the next honors physics course. How do I see what classes are available spring 2020?

1370,"Is it doable? Yes. Is it doable in one semester? No.

I took all three of those honors classes my freshman year, but I spread them out across two semesters. Here's my take.

MATH 2230 is hard as hell. It wasn't too bad if you ask the people that took it last year, because Hubbard was on sabbatical. He's back this year, and he's taking the reigns of 2230 again. This class was by far the hardest of the three, but also the one that covers the most content that its corresponding standard variant won't cover.

CS 2112 is to this day my favorite class at Cornell, though that's probably because between the three subjects, I like CS the most. Your mileage may vary. This class expects you to be able to develop real-world scale software during the semester, which inevitably requires a time investment. Also Kozen taught this the last three years, but Myers is coming back for fall 2019, so expect another difficulty bump here, as Kozen had been watering down the difficulty during his tenure.

PHYS 1116 is another very fun class. I personally found it more time consuming than 2112, but that's because my high school didn't offer AP Physics C, but I did have a lot of prior programming experience. Objectively, it's probably the least difficult of the three. That doesn't mean it's easy. Still expect long problem sets that'll take days to puzzle through.

Ultimately, I did take all three and do well in all three. Contrary to maybe some of the opinions here, I don't want to discourage you from going for these classes if you're genuinely passionate about it. Speaking from experience, each and every one of these honors classes offers a drastically different experience compared to their standard variants that, if you really love the subject, really can be irreplaceable.

That said, there's no way in hell you can do all 3 in one semester. If you're really dead-set on doing all three, I'd recommend doing what I did. 1116 is the only class of the three also offered in the spring, so imo the way to go is to push back 1116, so take 2230 + 2112 fall and 2240 + 1116 spring.

That's my two cents. Hope that helps.",0.5492,0.3568,0.0939

1530,"To start off, congrats on getting the TO option. I'll be a sophomore at the hotel school this semester and I can give you my two cents on the matter. So make money and live a life you dreamed of, is to put it lightly... vague. If you mean by making money you want a six figure salary and huge bonuses starting out of undergrad, it's totally possible but there are a lot of things you'd want to factor in. Pretty much all of the highest paying positions are in Investment Banking which has a pretty bad rap for 80+ hour work weeks and high drop out rates. (Both of my cousins left within 2 years). It's also a very competitive area because people are attracted to the large salary and prestige that Goldman Sachs puts on your resume. There's always a constant pressure at school to network, have high grades, and find internships. The good thing is that the Hotel School has an extensive alumni network and with a specialisation in real estate, many hotelies find internships and work their ways into the finance industry. This is the main draw over UCF in my opinion because the Hotel School is considered a ""target school"" by big banks. If you're looking at a more traditional hospitality job you'll have to settle for smaller paycheck. You won't be poor mind you, but starting off you won't be buying bottles of dom every weekend. A lot of people change their minds going through college and doing different internships so don't feel like you have to have everything already figured out. The other thing I'll say about Cornell's Hotel School is that there's a lot of emphasis on work-life-fun balance. Academics aren't extremely rigorous in my opinion but classes like intro to food ops/hotel ops have practicums in the Statler which force you to learn on the fly, and expose you to different sides to hospitality. Most students also take part time jobs in the Statler which pays nicely depending on where you are and there are leadership tracks that let students work up to real management levels and take initiative.

1532,"Coursework definitely provides a well-rounded business education in addition to all of the foundations you need for a career in hospitality management.

Course sizes, depends on the class. Lectures are typically 40-60 people. There are some smaller classes (business writing, organizational behavior during freshman year) that can be smaller (15-20 for biz writing, 25-30 for OB). Generally there’s a lot of class participation and it really doesn’t feel like a large lecture hall!

Courses absolutely prepare you for an internship—business computing especially! You’ll learn how to master Word, PowerPoint, and Excel to a crazy level that most professionals don’t even reach. Other classes, it depends on the internship. If you’re doing finance or real estate, the accounting, finance, and real estate classes help a ton. If you’re working at the front desk of a hotel, a little bit less so, but organizational behavior is really helpful to understand management and working with people.

There are a lot of resources that SHA has to offer its students like the extensive alumni network and also the people in the Office of Student Services, but you really have to be proactive to seek them out by making it a priority. Otherwise, I find that getting good summer internships is still very difficult regardless of SHA's name. The people are pretty great! Definitely the best part about coming to SHA and also Cornell.

The majority of the class is on classical field theory and focuses on Lie group symmetries in lagrangians and motivates particles/fields from there, as well as fun with Noether currents associated with U(1), SU(2), all that fun shit. You do Feynman diagram computations but you're given Feynman rules so it's just algebra. In terms of math, be expected to be good at multivariate calculus and undergrad-level quantum mechanics, but not really further. Fluency in special relativity is a must but PHYS 1116 ensures this. I had difficulty with (relativistic) tensors but you can pick this up. You most likely won't be doing any quantum field theory, no path integral or renormalization, no scattering theory. The fanciest thing you will do is ""decomposing direct products of representations of SU(2) into direct sums of representations"", aka learning how to read and use a table of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and probably being asked to derive the coefficients for something like spin-1/2 X spin-1 by hand exactly once. A lot of the physics majors that came out of 3316 (which is the official prereq) and hadn't yet seen spin had to be introduced to this concept in class, so don't worry if you don't know it—it's standard undergrad QM material.

1829,"I was crazy enough to bike through all of my 5 years at Cornell including the winter. Biking this campus, especially from west, is a rude awakening. The level of fitness required to do this will enlarge your legs significantly. You will be out of breathe every time you arrive at your destinations. You will (hopefully) carry a helmet everywhere you go until it is your signature fashion accessory. You'll have the occasional close run-ins with buses/cars when construction confuses people on the road. On parents weekend, just assume every car wants to mow you down. Cornell cops will give you trouble (and possibly a ticket) for biking on the sidewalk or through pedestrian crossing. In the winter, the snow pushes you out of the bike lane. Also the cold air hurts your face and lungs. Have you ever exfoliated your face with hail? I have. Ithaca weather is tough on bikes and you may need repairs within a semester and a half.

If you hate travel time as much as I do, this will be worth it. The amount of times a bike has helped me narrowly meet a deadline are hard to count.

Reschensee (German: [ˈrɛʃn̩ˌseˑ] (listen); Italian: Lago di Resia [ˈlaːɡo di ˈrɛːzja]) or Lake Reschen is an artificial lake in the western portion of South Tyrol, Italy, approximately 2 km (1 mi) south of the Reschen Pass, which forms the border with Austria, and 3 km (2 mi) east of the mountain ridge forming the border with Switzerland. With its capacity of 120 million cubic metres (97,000 ac·ft) it is the largest lake in the province. Its surface area of 6.6 km2 (2.5 sq mi) makes it also the largest lake above 1,000 m (3,300 ft) in the Alps. It is fed by the Adige, Rojenbach and Karlinbach and drained by the Adige.

Too many fucking kids think they’re independent adults that can make their own decisions when they’re still living off their parents money, getting tuition paid for, have a past of being dependent on mommy for everything. Then they think they come to college and they’re suddenly all grown and can go to all the parties they want, stay out till whatever hour they want. Fucking bullshit. I see kids at cornell tossing their tuition money into the fucking garbage, getting drunk and skipping classes. Then when mother doesn’t let them go to Miami for spring break they’re crying. 

You know what? Some parents truly are overbearing and controlling, but even more kids are fucking incompetent and hopelessly dependent. If your parents pay for your tuition they damn right have a right to know about your school/grades/internships (note I said know and not control). If your parents are adamant about your classes, maybe you have a history of undesireable academics. If they track your phone, well they shouldn’t and you should learn how to protect your privacy.

You'll have to sort of bear with this ridiculousness while your parents come to grips with the fact that you're an adult now and can make your own choices. I think the best strategy is to keep them informed about your life and don't try to make big decisions behind their back that way you can build up that trust.

Especially when you first move in, you're in this completely new environment- you might be far from home, you might not know anyone there, this might be the first time you've been without your family/friends for an extended period of time. It can be very easy to shut yourself in and stay holed up in your room and not really talk to anyone (been there, done that). The first few weeks are when people are most open to talking to new people and making new friends and establishing their friend groups, so take advantage of it. Go hang out in the dorm lounges/common areas sometimes instead of in your room. Talk to some of your dormmates- you're going to be near them for an entire year, and lots of people find their first great group of friends in their fellow dormmates (I know I did). When you're about to go eat, swing by some of their rooms- chances are they'll leave their doors open the first few weeks, and ask if they want to join you. Stuff like this really helps. 

You're not just restricted to dorm friends, however- clubs are a great way to meet new people. I met another great group of friends when I joined concert band. Clubfest is great for this- they hold it at the beginning of every year in Barton Hall- you can go around and see all the different clubs that Cornell has to offer, and hopefully find one that fits your interests. Chances are, if you find one you like, you'll be able to click well with the members!

Also, just generally be friendly and take interest in people you meet. Everyone is trying to make friends, and people will immediately gravitate towards others who are friendly and fun to be around!

Okay so this class has very mixed reviews. Some love it, some hate it. So take this with a grain of salt because I’m one of the people that hated it.

The 2.5hr session is required. And in my case it lasted the 2.5hrs. You talk about the readings and have to participate (otherwise you get a 0 for participation for the day and they add up unfortunately). The 1 page writings are kinda more a reflection on the reading and can be done half assed honestly. You have a project at the end which typically ends up just being some coffee chat, unless the TAs decide to screw you (as was with my group) and then you end up having a half baked project which then receives a meh grade all thanks to the TA being malicious. They really control your grade in this class, not an objective system in my experience.

Especially the evening sessions, be wary of those since they get very tiring very quickly and you struggle to participate (and get dinner because 7.30 for a 2.5hr class is an awkward time).

The class itself breaks down into a number of topics such as race, socioeconomic status, and a few others I forget. You do one for the whole semester and while you can put priorities down, you end up where they put you (but typically I think you end up in your top two, although I could be mixing that up with FWS). Then (and I’m butchering the titles here because I can’t remember that far back) you are either the target or the non-target group (so like in race you’re either a minority or you’re not) and spend the whole semester discussing it from that POV. So if you’re not comfortable being vulnerable then either try change into a topic that’s targeting you less or drop the class. Because again, if you don’t participate you don’t get a decent grade.

EDIT: I’ll try drop the links below that also touch on this class:

You check-in with your student ID, get into a line, jump in (they don't like diving), swim three laps, get out on the other side, and make sure they've got you down as a pass.

If you are unable to do this due to non-medical reasons (ie you don't know how to swim) you will need to take a PE class that teaches you how to swim as one of your required PE classes (unlike many PE classes, this has no extra fee), then attempt the test again before graduating.

2163,"I've had a couple of close friends have pretty different Army ROTC experiences, both within a couple years of my 2016 graduation.

One was a transfer from West Point because he hated the toxic culture there. At West Point, he was basically told to psychologically and physically bully (non-contact but ordering pushups and stuff) lower-ranked cadets. He had a breaking point and came to Cornell, where he became in charge of New Member Education at my frat, and student battalion commander for the Army ROTC. He really enjoyed Cornell, because there was, compared to West Point, a much more freeing environment, even within ROTC. He took it seriously and advanced well, but he had to be up early, out often. He did have a social life and did well in his classes, though. Since graduating, he served his mandatory time in the Army, not sure what rank he retired at. He was an intel specialist, and 1/3 of his division (?) was sent to fight ISIS in Iraq back when Mosul had been taken. He was going to rotate in but the field commander said he wanted to minimize the amount of new troops that had to get adjusted to local conditions. Now he works doing some business thing that I don't remember at a Fortune 500 company.

The other Army ROTC friend I had did ROTC for his first year at Cornell. He wanted to be in Diplomatic Security or something like that, and thought the military background would help. He talked to some professionals and they basically said that he'd be better off focusing on his grades and other extracurriculars than having been in the Army for a couple of years. He became an RA and got involved in clubs and such. After graduating, this guy joined the Navy to become an Intel Officer, but was seriously wounded in a training exercise (the paperwork for his limited duty after some surgery was delayed, so he was on meds during an exercise at 3am and cracked his head). Now he's been medically discharged but is ""in the hopper"" and could rejoin some training slots open up. For now he's beginning law school (not at Cornell), and he may stick with that or return to the Navy, or do both, depending on timing.

The second guy was my roommate for a semester. Most days he was out the door for morning training by 6, 6:15. He'd get back 2 hours later and try to go to sleep while I was getting ready for the day. He also had a small duffel of his kit that he had to keep track of and maybe maintain. So also be aware of the potential for roommate conflict if your schedules don't sync.

Class is not practical but more theory, you learn some sql and then relational algebra (which as you’ll see ties back to sql itself) but mostly it’s the design of databases, like b tree or hash indexing, type of stores, locks and concurrency. 

Personally I liked the class and some concepts came up in interviews for me but my only gripe was he taught some basics of sql in the first few weeks and left it be.

2438,"Since I really don't have anything better to do with my life, here's some actual feedback. It's almost entirely focused on style and maintainability-- I'm not going to pretend I know anything about NLP at all:

The way variables are named (snake_case vs camelCase) is inconsistent throughout the file and is mildly jarring. PEP8 recommends snake_case, but frankly, it doesn't matter either way (being someone who worked with Java before Python, I default to camelCase usually)- what does matter is that you should stick to one naming scheme throughout the module. Since praw uses snake_case, you should stick with it throughout.

I'm mildly indifferent about OOP in general, but it would probably be better to organize the functions into a class and specify attributes such as checkedPosts within it. Even if you don't shift this to an OOP-oriented style, some variable names aren't really clear at all. What does count do? Do you need global state for some things? Is handling output through global state (and resetting it frequently) really necessary? Generally, a linear flow of information is easier for people to follow, even if it ends up being more computationally complex in the end. In addition, there are globals that don't seem to be used anywhere (checkedComment)? It would be helpful to document what each attribute does- that might also make you re-evaluate if it ultimately is a necessary addition to the final product. It may also help you think more carefully about their names. There are a few that I found pretty confusing while reading through- some parameter names are also quite confusing as well. What is ""url""? When there are multiple urls in a function (and you end up comparing them), it would be helpful to add an additional descriptor there.

There are lots of arbitrary numbers, and to a lesser extent, strings (the regex in particular comes to mind) that occur in the code. These should be refactored into named constants (which, for the sake of clarity, should probably be uppercase SNAKE_CASE), similar to how you defined thisUser at the top of the file. Alternatively, push it into a separate constants module and import them into the namespace of this module. Either way, it makes tweaking things in your code much simpler and makes it generally more sustainable.

Unit tests are always nice. I don't have experience with mocking frameworks in Python, but mocking dependencies (in this case, praw) and unit testing for expected behavior is an important step in making a sustainable application. In addition, to make this possible, you should be ensuring that your module is being run as a script before executing your main loop (if \_\_name\_\_ == ""\_\_main\_\_"":)- see this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/419163/what-does-if-name-main-do for a short-ish explanation of what it does and why it's helpful.

Not really a strict critique, but something to consider- often, list comprehensions can be an elegant solution to problems as well, instead of for loops. For example, hasCommented could be implemented as: 

return any([comment.author == thisUser for comment in post.comments])

F strings are a nice feature to leverage over string concatenation in Python 3.6+. Personal preference, but I think that it’s much easier to parse visually.",0.1938,0.5076,0.2986

Like, the prelims are essentially homework questions that aren’t difficult if you studied (that’s the way it’s been with diff profs). It’s a very doable course that you can get an A in if you put in reasonable effort.

Don't have the expertise nor the time right now, but it seems like adding the subject code to the query would improve the bot massively (and it's hard to believe it was ever unleashed on this sub without that). When someone searches CS 3110, they should not be given results that are clearly about ECON 3110. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, a machine learning approach to this would be interesting, using the downvotes/upvotes as validation, but I personally don't have the expertise to implement that as of now. If one did transition to that, then the bot should split its responses into multiple different comments (within its own thread) to allow upvoting/downvoting specific results.

2576,"A lot of people bash Schuyler because of how lonely it can get. When I lived there I was in the basement and only saw my next door neighbor once the entire year. I did manage to make a few friends, but since the dorm mostly has transfers trying to adjust to a new life most people are just holed up in their rooms.

That aside it is possible to have a good time there. When I was there the game room was a bit crusty but still usable. The kitchens are better compared to what I've seen in other dorms too, and don't forget the volleyball net they have. 

The real biggest problem living in Schuyler is the effort (not time) it takes to get anywhere. The closest bus to campus only comes once an hour, if it is raining/snowing and you're one minute too late, you basically miss your first lecture. Walking up the slope is doable but becomes a drag real fast. I recommend walking downhill to the commons and taking the route 10 from Seneca street, which comes very frequently in the morning. Then if possible camp out on campus until after dinner, unless you can cook. I do not advise living off the vending machine for meals as I did. 

Sorry this post ended up getting long, but I wish the best of luck in Schuyler. If you manage to make a close friend in Schuyler to walk back and hang out with, you can have a fun time living there. It's just difficult to do that. Either way, you also need to give the extra effort to go to/return from campus and plan your time well.

Intended major: Animal Science (CALS)

Intended minor that I’m mentioning in my essay: Climate Change 

Ethnicity/Gender: White/Asian Female (from Nevada)

Weighted GPA: 4.629

Unweighted GPA: 3.829 (might change after first semester, lower or higher)

Class rank: 42/751 (average competitive level, public HS)

ACT: 31, retaking it to try for a 33+

SAT II: 760 Biology E and 680 on Math 2 which I plan on retaking

APs: I was not the best at the exams lol
* World History (3)
* Biology (3)
* Lang (3)
* US History (2)
* Psychology (5) 

Senior APs: Making 9 in total

* Gonna self study Environmental Science
* Calculus AB
* French Lang &amp;amp; Culture
* Government
* IB Literature, might take AP and IB exam because IB is free and I don’t know if I’ll pass it

Extracurriculars: pretty basic and most not long term...
* 4 years varsity track (will be) - only award I got was most improved, but that was given by my coach
* 3 years varsity tennis (joined sophomore year)
* Years 6-10 Orchestra - we played at a national conference in Chicago which required auditions, don't know if this is worth saying or not
* Private violin lessons for 2 years
* Private piano lessons for 4 or 5 years
* HOSA (STEM club) for 1 year, no awards or special positions
* Vegan club for 1 year, just a member

* VP of French Club, first year in this club 
* Might join Environmental Club if my friend gets it started 

Summer activities: these were both short and I don't know if it's worth anything, but I've never had a part-time or summer job.
* 2 weeks at a language camp in Paris 
* 2 weeks volunteering at a wildlife orphanage in Zimbabwe (50 hours)

Teacher recs: They’ll probably be average, but the two I’m asking know I’m interested in animals.

&amp;#x200B;

I disagree that, ""no matter what,"" only one student ended up doing a given assignment. While one guy in my group slacked off, the rest of us split things up in a pretty reasonable way for the most part. And while I initially didn't like the idea of random partners, even more so when we ended up with that one guy slacking, I think it was good to have to work with people I didn't already know and try to get along.

2772,"My issue with associating my real name with this project is that I'm hesitant to submit a PR that basically nukes a project, replaces basically all of the code with my own, and then dip afterwards. I don't have the time/energy/motivation to maintain this project (or any project, because I'm generally burnt out -not because I'm some amazing wunderkind programmer, but because I'm a tired as fuck college student-), and I don't really think it's positive to submit a giant PR to a project without any intention of working on it after doing a relatively large scale rewrite.

In hindsight I don't think that it was a necessary comment (and detracts from the rest of the comment), but my ability to positively contribute to any open source project is pretty limited right now, and I'm not a person that likes to half ass work.

And on the realm of ""nitpicking style""- frankly, I don't really understand this comment at all. Anyone (or hopefully, at least anyone with a CS degree) can hack together code that functions at some level for most tasks. In most enterprise/business situations, getting it working is a pretty trivial task; it's rare that there is some new novel situation that occurs. A huge amount of professional SWE work nowadays boils down to applying solutions that already exist to new business problems. Writing code in a sustainable way that is easy to maintain and modify in the future is 90% of the difficulty of writing good code. This is especially True when that code is shared with others, with the direct intention of having them modify that code. Writing code is easy, reading code is hard. People are more incentivized to work on projects where the code is clean and follows general standards (and only deviates from them with good justification), because it's challenging to start working on a new code base *even when* the code is well-documented and standardized. Having code that is messy/thrown together adds a whole layer of complexity to that. Any project where style isn't a priority has bad priorities, end of. This should especially be the case on smaller-scale personal projects, where you can work on developing those habits early on. I have lots of bad habits that I still have to catch myself on! It's normal.

Sure, it's not glamorous to focus on making code that is easy to read and maintain, but software engineering at any sort of scale is a team effort. Part of contributing to the team involves writing things in idiomatic ways- it boosts everyone's productivity.

2953,"**Chance Me!** 

Hi All,

I'm considering applying to Cornell Tech's Masters of Engineering Computer Science program and am wondering if its even plausible given my background as I cannot find much information on their website regarding ""prerequisites"" per say.

So about myself:

I'm 26yo, white male living in NY. 

**Education:** I got my BS Eng - Electrical Engineering (2014) and MS Eng - Computer Engineering from Stony Brook University (2017). My undergrad GPA was 3.25/4 (? I dont really remember) and my grad GPA was 3.75/4. Most of my education was focused around embedded system design, hardware design, digital logic so I did not take very many classes from the software side of things.

**Work Experience:** I've worked in industry for almost 4 years now. I did firmware engineering for 1.5 years in between my BS and MS and I've been working as a Digital Logic Design (ASIC/FPGA) Engineer for almost 2.5 years now. Likewise, I interned at Brookhaven National Laboratory for 2 years during my bachelors degree (full time during summer/winter breaks, and part time during the semesters, 20hrs/week) as a hardware tester for their National Synchrotron Lightsource II project (electron particle accelerator). I have programming knowledge but in no way am i formally trained and dont use it on a day to day basis for my work, but I do **code** (specifically, I write code in HDL (hardware description language), mainly SystemVerilog, which is exactly what is sounds like, code that describes a circuit or your digital logic implementation which is then translated into a physical circuit via synthesis, etc..). I am confident I can keep up with the program if given the opportunity, but I'm wondering if my background is too far removed from traditional CS applicants. The program doesnt really say what you should be expected to know going in i.e. (data structures and algorithms, algorithm analysis, what level of math you should know as typically CS majors take slightly different math than EE or CE, etc...).

My personal perspective on this matter is that this is soliciting changes directly to the code base, so it's clearly a post intended to get suggestions from not just customers, but maintainers. From a developer-to-developer standpoint, I think that fixing code that is unsustainable *is* addressing a fundamental issue with the bot. Would the sub really implode if they took it down for a few extra days to fix the structure of the code and worked on other features simultaneously? Developing those other features will also be easier afterwards. I don't really adhere to the ""move fast and break things"" attitude. I genuinely that schlepping stuff on top of the code as-is will only help to make it more convoluted and less workable in the future.

I also don't really agree that I'm prioritizing ""poorly"". I chose to provide advice, as-is, about what I think is important to the project long-term. I think that that's more important than a short-term goal of hacking together a fix to make it work less poorly. You could argue that I could do even -more- to offer suggestions, but help is help, no? I offer advice on what I think are relevant issues, and things that I am comfortable and confident making statements about. My intuition for fixing this bot would be some sort of tokenization/parser strategy, but that's so vague and nebulous that I think it's not useful advice at all (and I don't have the depth of background to probe further). I'm not willing to throw out random suggestions that I don't feel comfortable backing, so I declined to give any at all. Is that so bad?",0.0617,0.3109,0.6274

3084,"I mean, I totally get not having the time to contribute code (I said the same, at least for the time being), but the way you initially worded it came off wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

I get that readability of code matters, and maybe ""nitpick"" wasn't the right word, but focusing almost exclusively on the style when most people on the sub agree that the bot needs content changes seems like you're prioritizing a tad poorly. I know you ruled yourself out from making functionality suggestions/improvements and went on to focus on style, which is helpful in its own right, but I think the goal was to get the class bot to a useful state and worry about making the code base maintainable later. You could argue that the style changes should come before soliciting substantive help, but it's a small enough project imo that you can understand it somewhat quickly regardless of style. 

&amp;#x200B;

As someone who was willing to contribute functionality suggestions/code tweaks once settled back on campus, it feels like focusing so much on the style first was unnecessary. You're not wrong that practicing good style will help with all future projects, but it wasn't standing in the way of providing useful changes to the current project, as small as it was.

&amp;#x200B;

And for the record, not to insult the developers or anything, you can tell from the code that no fancy NLP magic went into this bot. This means that someone like you (or me) with no NLP experience could have contributed more than just style suggestions, and focusing only on them does little to fix fundamental issues with the bot.",0.1204,0.5122,0.3673

3147,"There's probably 2 parts to this.

1. Some of us had extensive experience coming into college. For example, Isay had done a couple internships as a researcher at a computer vision company before college. Others had significant programming/math experience which made it possible to start working on this kind of stuff immediately, instead of needing to learn the basics first.

2. That being said, I don't think doing ML research is as far from you as you think. Several of our members came into college with no ML/CS experience at all. ML is somewhat unique as a field in that it's expanding so fast that nobody has that huge of a head start. In addition, the fact that ML currently has a strong experimental component allows for motivated newcomers to be helpful as well. IMO, the most important thing for doing research in this field is a strong intuition of the basics. It's not like say... math where you'll often be well into your PhD before you can make serious contributions.

- get a decent sized group of at least average girls, and maybe 1-2 of ur really close/sociable guy friends.  
   - Use the girls to get you in, but even then youll probably get shit from a few guys.  
   - DO NOT try and big dick the guys on door, you will pay for it, you’ve gotta make these people your friends, not competition 

- there will be guys getting rushed there as well, people who were friends with with kids already in the house.  
   - talk to them, and get a medium sized group of guys who you like, and are sociable

- be respectful to the brothers, but not timid, play pong with them, if they invite you to their room TAKE THEM UP ON IT, don’t be a creep to girls they’re friends w, etc

- hang out with brothers you think like you, but don’t stretch for houses that are the “coolest”, go with the ones that have the best fit for you
   - they’re the ones most likely to invite you to banded events, rush events, or even just getting in the door, etc



TLDR: yeah it’s really fucking hard, at least for upper-mid/top houses.  At the end of the day tho, just do things with people you like.

-While you ultimately don't have to read absolutely every single paper that's assigned, I recommend you do anyway just because it'll help ground you in the course and you won't feel like you're skipping too much of the class. Depending on the class, you could get at least about 2 or 3 ten page papers a week(if there isn't a book). Also, when the readings are longer(it's philosophy so it's not gonna be easy to read lol) it can feel like an ordeal getting through them, so you'll just have to be extra motivated haha 

- if you've never written a Phil paper, the class might be a little difficult as well, simply because philosophy as taught in the states tends to be more focused on a dry, analytic style of writing. You will need to be very precise in your wording and careful not to skip steps in your reasoning, while maintaining enough clarity so that people can understand you. Flowery writing is pretty frowned upon when you're starting out lol, that's sth I had to learn when I took my first class(which wasn't an intro course). It could be difficult, but just make sure you talk to your TA cause they're the ones reading your paper. As long as you're on top of things and start the essays early you shouldn't have too much trouble, but don't think of starting anything last minute.

Ultimately I think if you're really invested in the class you shouldn't have too many problems, but if you're looking for an easy class, I don't think this particular Phil class is the best to start out with.",0.2994,0.4863,0.2143

I heard that the acceptance rate of COE is higher for females (7% for males vs. 19% for females from [here](http://irp.dpb.cornell.edu/university-factbook/undergraduate-admissions)), but I'm not sure if that will be affected by ED or not haha (heard that it's 10% for CAS, so more competitive).

It was a very interesting class and the professor was extremely nice, supportive and easy going. She would often extend deadlines and work with the students to help.

Reading list:

Island by Huxley,
Sinbad’s 7 voyages,
Gravel Heart by Gurnah,
Hayy Ibn Yaqzan

I might be missing one. But these are all interesting books focusing on islands and they’re influence on culture and literature, their perception... 

For each book, you write a 2 page essay, a 4 page expanded on that, and an 8 page full essay. It’s not so bad. I would DEFINITELY say it’s an easier FWS, especially if Alhabian is still teaching.

I had talked to my RA and other Cook House staff earlier today, and found out the many struggles they had in incorporating McGraw back into the On-Campus housing system. I'm happy to report that living in the house has gotten steadily more bearable since maintenance staff started showing up frequently (at least the toilets are functional now). I don't want to vent my frustrations onto Cornell staff in general, since in my experience some people in the housing office have been extremely patient and helpful before. My lingering question is mainly why 109 McGraw was pushed to house students so prematurely – is it to preserve the on-campus housing guarantee for sophomores? Did the university anticipate it to be up to standards by August at the time when SigEp was first kicked? This is probably wishful thinking, but are we are ever going to get pest control come over? Or a weight room for that matter (considering it might be a liability issue now that Cornell is  officially in charge, not to mention potential equipment and staffing costs)? Why does cornell housing seem to keep pushing first-years away from off-campus housing to reserve on-campus housing as if they're independent renters and not a branch of Cornell University? (i.e. they seem to care very much about securing contracts, even though their primary responsibility should be to ensure students are housed and reasonably satisfied?)

I'm part of the West Campus staff, so I know about the problems and the reason for the problems with 109 McGraw. I do agree that 109 McGraw is not renovated up to university standards, but there were a lot of factors beyond the control of the house administration. We do not want to provide bad housing- we truly care about the happiness of our residents- but we were dealt a bad hand. The fraternity that used to live at 109 McGraw completely trashed the house when they got kicked off campus for hazing. The house was covered in paint, littered with trash, the clocks were ripped out, the TVs were taken, and the pool table and other furniture was thrown out the window by the brothers of the frat. Additionally, many buildings on West Campus are being remodeled, and many more buildings have had to undergo emergency renovations. Because of that and the fact that Cornell is just painstakingly slow at doing anything, 109 McGraw was not prioritized in its renovation. And because the frat trashed the building, extra renovations were expected. The weight room is closed because the frat took all the equipment with them. 109 McGraw was always supposed to have laundry machines, but the maintenance people were late in getting the machines installed. The administration at Cook pestered maintenance facilities the entire summer to try to get renovations done faster. We expected 109 McGraw to be done before students arrived, equipped with the proper amenities, but it was truly out of our hands. I'm sorry 109 McGraw is not up to the standards we hold here on West Campus. If it were up to the staff at Alice Cook House it would be, but unfortunately circumstances conspired against us.",0.0173,0.1872,0.7955

My questions are:

-How am I looking in turns of admission? Is ED a must, or can I get in without binding?

-I am applying to the College of Engineering. Are the SAT Subject Tests a must? I can get around Math II, but Physics will be legitimately challenging considering I've only just started AP Physics 2. Would it be better to risk submitting a potentially bad Physics score by November 1st (if I do ED), or just not have a score at all?

There is a shitton of space for improvement, and just because Cornell invests more than other schools doesn't mean they should be investing even more. I don't know where you did your masters, but Cornell should be investing multiple times more than the national average, and the national average is already pretty piss-poor. 

We live in an age where depression and anxiety rates in college students have nearly doubled in less than a decade; ~a third of college students reported being **too depressed to function** during 2013, *over half* reported **overwhelming anxiety**, and **one in ten** have *attempted suicide* ([APA source](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2014/09/cover-pressure)). Those are batshit statistics, and its clear that a lot more needs to be done. 

But specifically speaking to Cornell's mental health services, the direction the school is taking CAPS is pretty... just nonsensical. Rather than having students meet with a counselor regularly, they're pushing students towards a drop-in, drop-out appointment method, where you stop by and meet with a counselor for 25 minutes. The advantage is supposed to be that you get treated quicker, which was a complaint many had. But, the long appointment queue stemmed from the fact there simply aren't enough counselors for the number of students who need counseling (see statistics above, those are *national averages*, think about Cornell). 

However, I really think (and many others do as well) that this is just going to lead to a worse situation. How is talking with someone who doesn't have the background or context of multiple meetings over the course of months going to help? Especially if the meetings are set to be much shorter (you can't request for a 60 minute meeting for the drop-in sessions, they **must** be 25), you're going to spend a good chunk of that appointment giving context and repeating yourself, laying down foundation that usually happens in the first 1-2 meetings.

People seek help not because they're feeling down one day and just need someone to talk to. Its due to their mental framework on how they deal with their environment inherently leads to moments of depression and anxiety. Its a structural issue, not something that can be fixed in 25 minutes. It takes lots of work, and a quality relationship with medical professionals to rectify that mental framework, and you're not going to get that out of the drop-in, drop-out system. It really doesn't feel like they give a shit about the quality of the counselling, just the way it looks on paper: More students being helped with shorter waiting period = good PR.",0.0264,0.2095,0.7641

4152,"I'm glad to hear that living in 109 McGraw is becoming more bearable. Hopefully, with repeated feedback to maintenance staff and administration, necessary changes will be made to make living there more comfortable. 109 McGraw was anticipated to be up to standards by the time move-in began. Unfortunately, with the added complications I mentioned earlier, they were unable to do so. It was not Alice Cook House's intention to house students in a building that was not up to regulation. Cook House often acquires the fraternity houses of frats that have been kicked off campus to provide more on-campus housing for the many students who want to live on campus. West Campus houses many transfers in addition to returning sophomores, and although sophomores have guaranteed housing, transfers do not. Additionally, many transfers want to live on campus, and my thought is that Cornell wants to provide as much opportunity for people who want to live on campus to do so. As to your question the weight room, I don't believe 109 McGraw will get a weight room partly due to the expense and liability of equipping the room, but also because the gym in Noyes is located on West Campus and is fairly accessible for all students who live on West Campus. Additionally, no other Cook building has a weight room, and if one were put in 109 McGraw only residents of 109 McGraw would be able to access it because the building can only be accessed though manual keys. As to your pest control question, there is a certain protocol for certain types of pests which you can ask your SA about, and they can contact the proper facilities for you.  If it is regarding animals such as bats, rodents, skunks, etc. then you should really talk to your SA, however if you are dealing with insects, a maintenance request should be placed online. I hope I addressed most of your concerns, and I wish you the best of luck moving forward. If you have any problems, reach out to the SAs, house office, or assistant dean.

North: Start with going to the Beebee lake trail. If you want to run more, after the Beebee lake bridge (opposite side of the lake to the Thurston bridge) go up the stairs, turn left, then go across the other bridge, then turn right on Forest Home. This will lead you to the botanical gardens -- if you go up the hill and keep right,  following the loop  you'll get to the Newman Overlook, which is one of my favorite places on campus.  Continue the loop and return more or less the way you came. You can also loop around Mundy Wildflower Gardens/the Botanical Gardens building, which is on the other side of Forest Home. 

West: Get to Stewart ave then run \~north to the Stewart Ave bridge. Then turn right to the Fall Creek trail to run up the hill (near the suspension bridge). Either continue straight (around the Johnson museum) or cross the suspension bridge then run up the rest of the hill on Fall Creek Dr (ends up around Risley). Depending on how much more you want to run, you can add on the North routes. 

Collegetown: Start with going to the casc gorge trail entrance by CTB. Run to the end (pretty short), then up the trail/stairs to Hoy Rd by Rhodes Hall. Continue until you get to a parking lot/the Synchrotron area. If you turn left, you'll end up around the Dairy Bar, where you can get to the Botanical Gardens.  If you turn right onto Pine Tree Rd, and go up a small hill you can take a left across a bridge to a one mile (each way, so two miles there and back) trail in the woods (East Ithaca Recreation Way). You could also continue running up the longer hill, then turn right onto Maple Ave by the cemetery then turn on Dryden to go back the way you came for a shorter route. Or, if you want to run more, keep running past East Hill Plaza and you'll end up at the East Ithaca Nature Preserve, which has lots of trails.",0.2869,0.7008,0.0123

4355,"&gt; Asian American students suffer disproportionately because students from asia, specifically China, cheat excessively and also have very poor English skills which they obfuscate in their admission process

Uh, *no*, they suffer disproportionately because affirmative action and the concept of an ""overrepresented minority"" not only enables admissions departments to impose higher, unfair standards on Asian-American applicants, but also causes the rest of the population to be A-okay with it. 

&gt;students from China proper give the rest of the Asian student population a bad name

What? If anyone thinks less of an Asian student because some Chinese national students cheat and don't speak english well, that's on them for being, well, literally racist. This whole concept of a ""bad name"" is a pathetic attempt to shift the blame from practitioners of racism and prejudice onto the victims themselves.

It's not as if Cornell would normally be charging full tuition and they get it waived exclusively for the summer. The people in the second program you're comparing it to are able to pay full price - otherwise they wouldn't be there - so of course it is different. It's actually kind of similar to how high-income students pay more tuition etc., which funds the education of low-income students. And I'd argue that an extra, more relaxed semester of college will definitely help ease the transition and put students on a more level playing field, and is an effective way to do so on a large scale.   
  
The argument you're making is more like, we shouldn't allow low-income underperforming students into Cornell in the first place. This goes against the mission of Cornell.

4374,"This is an interesting debate. I guess the question is if Cornell is doing this for altruistic reasons or personal image reasons. Look at it from this side: Cornell recognizes that these students have done exceedingly well in the environment available to them,  but even such work ethic makes them sightly unprepared for cornell, due to the nature of it being an intensive, elite university. As a result, Cornell thinks that by helping to the under-resourced students, they will be able to leverage the opportunities and work hard to succeed. 

Or, Cornell arbitrarily picked a bunch of minorities to boost their public image. They want blacks and Hispanics to fluff up their stats and they’re willing to spend the extra money to do so. 

Personally, I think it’s the former. There is a wide disparity between social resources and ability at Cornell and PSP seeks to close that gap by helping those who have proved that they can succeed under unideal circumstances.",0.4342,0.4649,0.1009
4375,"Why does the university feel the need to spend so much money on PSP? All of the students get to take classes for free, they get free housing on West Campus, they get free meal plans. I’ve even heard that students required to be in the program were complaining about loss of income due to not being able to work a summer job while doing the program, so some students actually get paid to do it. And the kicker is it’s not like a special program for the highest performing students to do research or something - it’s specifically designed for incoming students who the university felt needed extra academic help before their first semester. Over a summer I worked with PSP students (I won’t say in what capacity for privacy), and a number of the students are like middle school level in writing and math and whatnot. Cornell is spending a ton of money on students who bring down the rest of the class - there are students there who get denied from Binghamton and Stony Brook who get into it.  I get that they want to promote diversity, but there must be other ways without using up a ton of resources. Imagine if West Campus housing was available to current students who were staying over the summer. There’s another program that has high school students staying on North Campus over the summer, but at least they’re paying the regular cost of housing and dining for it.",0.083,0.4871,0.4299

4464,"Hi! I’ll be applying as a spring transfer. I’m kinda worried about my chances of getting in because of my HS stats. Thanks in advance btw!!

Race/ethnicity: Asian, Vietnamese

Gender: Male

Stats: Major: Biology

HS GPA: 2.8 UW, 3.14 weighted (grades increased throughout time in high school to a 3.4-3.5 UW, 3 A.P. classes taken so I assume weighted would be around a 3.8)

College GPA: 4.0 (approx 55 units taken, 70 by the end of fall 2019) clearly the strongest part of my profile

SAT: 1270/1600 (didn’t study but can’t retake in time and don’t really want to, not submitting to Cornell anyways)

Recommendations: 3 (from biology and chemistry professors, and one from a lab coordinator) 
Bio teacher: 7 or 8/10
Chem teacher: 8 or 9/10
Lab coordinator: 10/10 (the letter he wrote got me two big scholarships)

EC's/awards: 
1. Volunteered at boys and girls club every summer for four summers

2. worked in a research lab at San Francisco state university studying avian malaria (9 months)

3. attended dermatology grand rounds at UCSF

4. got two scholarships for $12k and tuition, as well as an IRA grant, one more scholarship for $500 (all were from SFSU)

5. helped lead cultural pride events at high school, sent red cards with immigrant rights to families in SF in 2018 (beginning of ICE raids)

6. got a poem published in high school, university scholarship for $500

7. volunteered at the California pacific medical center (ACU, med/surg unit, ED, TICU) and have experience working with patients (prep for procedures, taking blood sugar, helping to administer insulin), assisting in the hospital (making blood culture kits, prepping rooms, escorting patients, etc.) 
*CPMC is probably my best EV



Essay: about growing up poor (&lt;$20k/yr family income in San Francisco) and gay in a home that was abusive (homophobic, internal racism) and unsanitary (mice, parents hoarding, one bedroom apt where we slept on same bed) affected my high school grades. In short, I was looking for a way out of my living situation and couldn’t focus on school. When I got to college, I found out how I would escape that living situation — by pursuing my love of medicine. I also discuss various ways I’ve pursued science (see ECs). I’d give this an 8 or 9/10.

Another essay discusses what I’d do at these schools, and how the culture, classes, research labs, etc. will help me pursue my dreams of dermatology and allow me to compound on knowledge gained from SFSU. It also discusses what I hope to change in medicine (gentrification, other social justice issues) and how those schools can help me learn how to do so.

pretend you want to find a Cornellian that's into Frank Ocean music

&amp;#x200B;

other Cornellians can see that someone is a fan of Frank Ocean

but they can't see who

&amp;#x200B;

it's only when someone else also says ""frank ocean""

that they can see you and you can see them

&amp;#x200B;

""frank ocean"" was an example, but you can literally say anything.

""astronomy"" ""korean"" ""rick and morty"" ANYTHING anything

&amp;#x200B;

you can stack them too

so if you write ""frank ocean"" ""skateboarding"" ""pewdiepie""

and someone else also writes all 3 of those things

you'll be able to see everything you have in common

Intended major(s): Biological Sciences (CAS) or Bioengineering

Ethnicity/Gender: Asian Male (ha), no hooks

GPA: Around 95ish/100, maybe jumping to around 98/100 if only academic courses are considered

Class rank: No official rankings but guessing around top 15/\~700

SAT/SAT II: 1580 SAT (800 M), 790 Bio M, 760 Math 2 (retaking in October along with Chem)

Coursework: Full IB Diploma (Lit, World History, Chem HLs and Math, Bio, and French SL - school offers limited selection), predicted around 43/45 unofficially. Also dual enrolling in first-year engineering math courses at the local university.

Awards: Top 1% in a national biology competition with around 3500 competitors. Some top MUN awards from the University of Chicago and McGill conferences. Also some miscellaneous math contests but nothing too important.

Extracurriculars:

* Some bioengineering research at the university, co-authoring a paper but not sure if it will publish in time. (11 and 12)
* Founder of an organization connecting other high school students to research opportunities. We're pulling in some numbers in terms of interest and sponsorship but nothing too big. (11 and 12)
* MUN. Co-captain of the school team and involved in running the school conference with around 800 attendees. Been to a few international conferences (see above) with decent results. (9, 10, 11, and 12)
* Cooking. Making meals for the fam and doing some recipe development. Mainly included this one as it ties into some of my essays. Plus I really enjoy it. (9, 10, 11, and 12)
* An executive leader in a local health science conference. My role involves inviting speakers and dealing with logistical issues. Attendance ranges from 150-250 people depending on the year. (10, 11, and 12)
* Club leader of the school's bio and chem clubs. Leading activities and inviting speakers. (11 and 12)
* Volunteer at a local science center. Working with kids and explaining the exhibits + leading interactive games. Not that many hours, maybe around 20-30 tops? (11 and 12)
* Trainer of our school's various athletic teams as part of the Sports Medicine class I'm taking. Helping with practices and injuries. Around 90 hours by the time I apply. (10, 11, and 12)
* Part of the leadership committee of our school's mentoring program. Mostly helping out the new students with their schedules and questions on the first day of school. Connecting around 50-60 mentors to 700 students. (11 and 12)

Essays and LORs: Not going inflate my writing. I'd say 6-7/10 is a good estimate? Possibly even lower. Asking my English and Biology teachers for recs. English around 8/10 because I put more emotions into this class I think. Biology probably 7/10. The teacher thought I was really knowledgeable but there weren't that many personal moments.

Provided that the university gives them extra time/resources to take classes that helps them catch up on education, these (PSP) students could possibly thrive and be on equal standing or do better than ""typical"" Cornell students. Given that these students are financially disadvantaged, they likely cannot afford to take these ""catch-up"" classes. I've seen many PSP students accomplish great things.

It is arguably the most even number in that you could divide it by 2 an infinite number of times and it will always be divisible. I feel like this will turn into some memed up copypasta if I go any further. 

Anyway, if you want you could think of it from a signals point of view, with some piecewise condition like n is even, n is odd, would be dumb to have to lump 0 in with the even case everytime you do something like that.

4915,"I think Cornell Engineering, as a whole, is designed really well for engineering career prospects. 

Engineering employers, or employers in general, focus on candidates' experiences more than their GPA. Sure, grades are important and some employers may even set minimum GPAs, but for the most part, your resume and interviews are what they care about. The college has a wide range of opportunities for this. First, there are a lot of different project teams, and I think the rigor and learning experience of being part of one is quite unique to Cornell. You get to meet and work with people outside of your classes, network with alumni of your project team, and have a lot to talk about during your interviews. There are also a lot of research opportunities you can find by contacting professors whose research areas interest you. And even if neither of these appeal to you, you can still take advantage of the co-op program, which often leads directly to a full-time offer. The career office does an excellent job of guiding students through this process, as well as things like mock interviews. The college also offers the 1 year MEng program which has a lot of advantages of its own.

That said, there are also a lot of engineering students who aren't necessarily interested in engineering careers. Engineering --&gt; medical school is more common than you'd think, and I personally went from engineering to law school. Personally, I felt like there weren't nearly as enough support for students like us. However, this is totally understandable as we are, after all, a minority and the school should rightfully focus on the career opportunities applicable to the vast majority of students. To elaborate a little more on this point, I just felt like neither the professors nor the curriculum suggested alternative careers for engineering students (med/law/etc) and so only people who developed such interests externally had the opportunity to consider such options. It's also not easy for engineering students with such interests to identify and connect with each other, or with relevant alumni for that matter. Furthermore, the career fairs, while excellent for engineering careers, do not serve these students equally. But again, I'm not trying to disparage the college, just putting my two cents in.",0.3475,0.5155,0.137

5206,"There's no replacement for good therapy if you're having mental issues. With that said, there are some tricks to make yourself work better. Set up checklists of things you *will* do every day, and try to get into the routine of doing them no matter what. Get up early to shower and go to class, and get at least 8 hours of sleep- if you're on your phone or computer 9 hours before you have to wake up, immediately stop and go to bed. Get a few hours of exercise every week, be that a gym class, running, swimming, whatever. The key is to make things automatic, so even if you don't want to do them, you just will anyway. You'll always feel as if you don't want to do things, but after you do them, you'll be glad you did. But seriously, all this is just a stopgap- if you're having trouble with basic functioning, you should talk to a therapist, and maybe get pharmaceutical help.",0.3141,0.5221,0.1638

People aren't getting admitted because they have amazing academic background etc., they are being admitted because they will work well on the team.

And if you do that you won’t graduate with any loans.

If you don't have a string instrument, we have 2 violins that can be borrowed (cellos and violas coming in the future) or you can rent an instrument here: [https://bit.ly/303C6rr](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hickeys.com%2Finstrument_rentals%2Frental_price_charts.php%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1XdoqRai3-bS2T6z1y8YIFUKsxuA3rQhKsqZMjR1hxG-Ml6apvstU699E&amp;h=AT3BZ3eLzLgQ7V7pPANcIN1-JVKgG9_qp6Xn13WOhgMbfiVI7QtF9jNQx1A5bnmp8LM7daPukiCNooWeTtED4PhgkO4I_leAHsDpvgtJlnbxtOkPbpTEbTa53Z8MVWXM04ksCv77zmb0LoECvzJCS3VpDrY).

5517,"You'll hear a lot of polarized opinions on career fair. Some say it was the key to their internships/full times, others say it was a complete waste of time. I'm in the latter category. I would go further as to say I was actually worse off with how much time I wasted on career fair related things.
  
All the interviews I got from career fair ended up in the dirt. They were rushed, badly planned, and in one case (not gonna name the (big) company) the interviewer screwed up and didn't tell me a key piece of information that I needed to pass the technical question until the last five minutes, then blamed me for wasting time. I tried to provide feedback to the recruiter, but of course they don't care because as you said, they have a sea of people who will apply no matter what.
  
I started to enjoy the interview process when I later applied online. Glassdoor has TONS of postings, so your responses will go up by virtue of numbers alone. You'll find that those companies actually care about getting you and so the interview process is a lot more two-sided.
  
I'm not going to career fair this year, but I'm looking for full-times, not internships, so I don't _really_ have a time limit on this. If you're going for an internship, you might want to.
  
I always advise people to go to career fair at least once, just because some people get value out of it, and there's no harm in doing everything you can to get a job. But if you've gone before and didn't get anything out of it, you'll probably experience the same thing again.",0.0848,0.3332,0.582

It's about the ability to persist through massive challenges and how you handle workloads.**  My experience and knowledge was never questioned due to lack of a degree, but it was my commitment and trustworthiness.  Almost a right of passage.  Now, 250 pages seems insane but imagine yourself persisting through it, eventually sitting behind a desk reading resumes and interviewing candidates to work under you.

We also have some socials (like movie night, Nintendo Switch party etc.) where you can get to know other members of the club.

This [article](https://www.businessinsider.com/at-least-70-of-jobs-are-not-even-listed-heres-how-to-up-your-chances-of-getting-a-great-new-gig-2017-4) also says: 

&gt; Only 7 percent of job applicants get [a referral from someone who’s already working with the company], yet referrals make up 40 percent of new hires. Clearly, networking isn’t just one potential route to finding a new job — it’s actually the most effective path.

Just 'applying online' is a pretty hit-or-miss way of going about things. I applied to over 500 companies last year and couldn't land a single Software Engineering gig (ended up participating in the Cornell Tech Summer Research program, which I think turned out for the best, but thats besides the point). I have a gpa &gt;3.5 and am a Physics + CS double major, so it's not like I'm completely unqualified to touch code. I have a friend in ORIE who landed a software engineering internship last semester after &lt;50 applications. The difference: he had a referral (and wasn't asian). 

Not saying a Career Fair is suddenly going to open up 5 times the number of jobs as applying online, but I can tell you from personal experience that a network is extremely important. You're not going to build one up tomorrow, or at all even, but just keep in mind that simply applying online isn't a great strategy.",0.2606,0.5433,0.1961

After you shake the recruiters hand and introduce yourself, you can talk briefly about who you are, your interests, and one latest/greatest work experience you've had. This is especially useful when the recruiter doesn't start talking immediately after the introduction or when they say ""so tell me about yourself"" or something like that. 

If you do some research on the company ahead of time, it's nice to show a bit of knowledge about what they do so that you seem more interested. This is also when you'd highlight some of your experiences that are related to what they do. That relation can be like being in the same subfield of whatever industry they are in or using a similar technology, serving a similar community, etc. I've always found that they are excited when you know about what they do, especially if they aren't a household name/easily understood company. 

It's not an interview though, more like a conversation during which you want to hit certain points. Also have some questions to ask because after they talk a bit it's usually up to you to keep things going.

Wushu is **performance-oriented** rather than combat-oriented, so while you may be able to beat people up with Wushu, the focus is mainly on aesthetic and exercise.

Joining is easy! **No experience is necessary**, and there are no tryouts; we will teach you everything you need to knowǃ Our first practice is September 16, 8:15 pm at Barton.

As a form of exercise, Wushu will work out your whole body, push you past your comfort zones, and enable you to maneuver in ways you never knew you could. This is the promise we make to all new members of Wushu.

Feel free to email [cornellwushu@gmail.com](mailto:cornellwushu@gmail.com) with any questions or visit us on Facebook: [https://www.facebook.com/cornellwushuclub/](https://www.facebook.com/cornellwushuclub/). We'll also be at ClubFest, so come check out our booth and performance at 3:15 pm!

5869,"Keep in mind that Cornell CS grads tend to get the best CS jobs, and the best CS jobs are in extremely high COL areas. You have to read in-between the lines.

For example:
&gt; For example, HUD defined “Low Income Limits” in San Francisco as $82,200 for an individual and $117,400 for a family of four in 2018,

That 102-112k base you get out of school in the bay isn't all it's cracked up to be. If you had a wife/husband and two kids you were supporting you would be considered *impoverished* on a *six-figure* salary.

This is still very good money for an out-of-college job, but by no means is it, ""I've made it"" money. 

___________________

Conversely a lot of MechE jobs are in cheaper areas. A very large Lockheed Martin office is in Fort Worth, Texas and compensations are generally around ~65-75k out of school for just a MechE B.S. You see 112k vs. 70k and you say, ""wow! mechE/&lt;other major&gt; blows!"" but COL plays a very big role:

See this [cost of living calculator](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=United+States&amp;country2=United+States&amp;city1=San+Francisco%2C+CA&amp;city2=Fort+Worth%2C+TX). While this does not tell you the whole picture it gives a good estimation of COL differences between places. 

CS looks amazing and mechE/etc looks like shit when you just go by numbers but six-figures in the bay/nyc isn't that great and 65-80k in some place like fort worth is pretty damn good.

5944,"Triple major in three years -&gt; max credits or slight over max credits is normal for me. It's possible if you optimise your time quite heavily -- though it's not for everyone.

Lifestyle-wise, I don't cook but order cheap takeout most days. Most lunches I just grab a sandwich and work through it. When I have meals with friends (once or twice a week), it's deliberate and engaging, and not a kind of 'sit together for the sake of sitting together and it's awkward to leave too quickly' sort of affair -- something I experienced a lot in my freshman year, I think. I also usually work in teams (for projects and assignments) with close friends so we usually shoot the crap while working hard. I also have time to Skype home frequently on the Fridays and weekends.

Studies-wise, I usually leave one course as a 'slack' course to chill a bit. As others have mentioned, not all course credits are equal. I actually find Intro courses a lot more work than the higher-level classes -- possibly because Intro courses really require a wide breadth of material. I found my higher-level Math courses easier than MATH 2220, for example. Likewise for my GOVT Intro courses -- boy, the readings.

It also helps that I have a good foundation in CS &amp; Math built from experience, and most of the programming assignments seem quite straightforward to me. One thing I'd say is that a lot of time is wasted if you switch from project to project without completing any one, because the context switch for you to get 'in the zone' for a different project is very costly. Because of this, I usually finish most projects in one or two sittings over a short span so that I don't have to think about it again.

Why do I do this? There's just a lot of interesting and useful material. CS is just a lot of fun, and Math opens up a lot of higher-level CS work that you can do. My Govt major seems tangential but with the kind of courses I took (public policy, advanced regression analysis), I saw the same concepts coming up in my Math courses (Probability &amp; Stats) and my CS research.

For example, I could have gone to every class for Greek mythology and maybe gotten an A or A+, or I can go to 0 classes, cram for few hours before a prelim, do the extra credit, and get an A-.

I think most people find that as they take more credits, the amount of time you spend dicking around doing nothing is a lot higher than you expected, and that is the first to go.

Also the time management and mental stamina will come naturally. Eventually you just can’t operate without doing so.

If I had never taken Physics but took the same number of credits, just in CS courses, I could have graduated in 2.5 years, with no AP credit.

Race/ethnicity: Asian, Vietnamese

Gender: Male

Stats: 

Major: Biology

College: CAS

HS GPA: 2.8 UW, 3.14 weighted (grades increased throughout time in high school to a 3.4-3.5 UW, 3 A.P. classes taken so I assume weighted would be around a 3.8)

College GPA: 4.0 (approx 55 units taken, 70 by the end of fall 2019) clearly the strongest part of my profile

SAT: 1270/1600 (didn’t study but can’t retake in time, not submitting to Cornell anyways)

Recommendations: 3 (from biology and chemistry professors, and one from a lab coordinator) Bio teacher: 7 or 8/10 Chem teacher: 8 or 9/10 Lab coordinator: 10/10 (the letter he wrote got me two big scholarships)

EC's/awards/experiences:

1.	⁠Volunteered at boys and girls club every summer for four summers
2.	⁠worked in a research lab at San Francisco state university studying avian malaria (9 months)
3.	⁠attended dermatology grand rounds at UCSF
4.	⁠got two scholarships for $12k and tuition, as well as an IRA grant, one more scholarship for $500 (all were from SFSU)
5.	⁠helped lead cultural pride events at high school, sent red cards with immigrant rights to families in SF in 2018 (beginning of ICE raids)
6.	⁠got a poem published in high school, university scholarship for $500
7.	⁠volunteered at the California pacific medical center (ACU, med/surg unit, ED, TICU) and have experience working with patients (prep for procedures, taking blood sugar, helping to administer insulin), assisting in the hospital (making blood culture kits, prepping rooms, escorting patients, etc.) *CPMC is probably my best EC
8. Familial responsibilities: had to take control of financial issues to make sure my family wouldn’t get taken advantage of by real estate agents, so I taught myself to be financially literate. I also help with taxes and other financial documents since my family doesn’t speak fluent english. 

Essay: about growing up poor (&lt;$20k/yr family income in San Francisco) and gay in a home that was abusive (homophobic, internal racism) and unsanitary (mice, parents hoarding, one bedroom apt where we slept on same bed) affected my high school grades. In short, I was looking for a way out of my living situation and couldn’t focus on school. When I got to college, I found out how I would escape that living situation — by pursuing my love of medicine. I also discuss various ways I’ve pursued science (see ECs). I’d give this an 8 or 9/10.

Another essay discusses what I’d do at these schools, and how the culture, classes, research labs, etc. will help me pursue my dreams of dermatology and allow me to compound on knowledge gained from SFSU. It also discusses what I hope to change in medicine (gentrification, other social justice issues) and how those schools can help me learn how to do so.

Even applying to med school costs thousands of dollars and when you add years of tuition on top of that and living expenses, it becoming a very daunting figure (we’re talking hundreds of thousands). For this reason, many people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds won’t pursue medicine.

It likely won’t increase the amount of physicians. Although there is a nationwide physician shortage, the bottleneck doesn’t occur with medical school seats but rather with residency positions (which are federally funded). If Weill Cornell and other med schools simply expanded their class size we’d no longer see the (essentially) guaranteed job security that medicine provides.

I don't use the green username often, but felt like this was a dangerous message to send to freshmen considering CS, even if just barely taken seriously. 

&gt;&gt; If you are drowning in stress and can't seem to manage a 3.5+ gpa, you should consider other majors that interest you. 

&gt; So most people at Cornell?

This is more targeted towards CS majors, especially underclassmen. I've found that a lot of CS majors that struggle in the early courses are just doing it because its the major they think they should be in. This is a horrible way to spend you 4 years in college. There are plenty of other majors (like InfoSci) that are much less stressful and still have access to jobs in the tech sector. Even if the major isn't necessarily 'less intensive', they'll likely be less stressed if they're doing something they actually enjoy. I'm not trying to 'gatekeep' CS, tech literacy is something extremely important to me. But, if you hate 1110 and 2110 and can't manage higher than a B-, it's not going to suddenly click for you in 3110 and 3410.",0.1077,0.3795,0.5128
6578,"Look, I'm aware that Eagle Scout is a meaningful accomplishment and I'm not trying to trivialize the experience. But it's not comparable to being top 200 US in math/physics, winning a national science fair, best pianist in your state etc, in terms of both selectivity and relevance. These are the type of things that can make you stand out and get into a top school on their own or with little extra. By comparison Eagle Scouts are a dime a dozen, which is not to say that it won't help but it's not going to make you stand out on its own. I do agree that Duke is probably the better option for you though. As a Cornell physics (AEP) major, Duke's program is not nearly as good or well-known as Cornell's, but at the undergrad level it doesn't matter that much tbh and if you decide not to do physics Duke will probably be better for whatever it is you decide to do. But keep in mind that you have a very real chance of not getting into either of these schools ED, so don't be disappointed if this does happen.  
  
EDIT: just now am seeing state chess champion. If this legit means you are the best ranked player in SC, that could help you a good deal.

This is in no way meant to be a brag, but this past summer I just interned at what people would consider to be a big n company. So if you end up not getting into any project teams, it'll be okay.

# I hate de new cocktaiw wounge 

I honestwy bewieve dat most of de new changes made to de Cocktaiw wounge wewe dewibewatewy made specificawwy to piss **me** off. I get dat dis is a much wess popuwaw opinion dan ""de Cowneww Daiwy Sun is a gawbage pubwication"" but I HAVE TO get dis shit off my chest (and weawwy, weawwy don't feew wike doing StatMech).

Evewyding about de owd cocktaiw wounge was *pewfect*. I spent mowe time in Cocktaiw dan in my own home duwing my sophomowe yeaw. de bwue mini-couches dat yuw couwd put side by side to cweate de pewfect sweeping pod, de chaiws wewe at de pewfect height so yuw wouwdn't stwain yuw neck aftew 12 houws of wowk, and de swoped foot aweas in de iswands and two-seatews wewe gweat. Now wook at dis gawd-fowsaken mess. If yuw new to de subweddit ow a fweshman, yuw in fow a wide, I'm about to do what I do best: bitch and moan wike a 16 yeaw owd teen on weawity tewevision as an excuse to avoid doing wowk. 

## de Centwaw wounge:
yuw know what I'm tawking about. de awea whewe cocktaiw 'bends'. dey used to have de comfiest seats on campus. I get why dey decided to swap out de owd chaiws (if dey awen't on sawe anymowe, and I'm pwetty suwe dey haven't been cweaned since de 80s), but de new puwchases awe just facking stupid. 

wif aww de new fuwnituwe, its viwtuawwy impossibwe to get dwough dis awea wifout bumping into someone and getting a wude gwawe, ow cutting dwough deiw seating awea and awkwawdwy twipping ovew a powew cowd. de taww chaiws awe awso sowe on de eyesh. de whowe awea is just so... cwowded. 

Awso, one of de main advantages of de owd chaiws was dat dey wewe wewativewy mobiwe. yuw couwd move dem awound and peopwe often did, moving dem fwom tabwe to tabwe. dese new ones awe widicuwouswy wawge and **awe obviouswy meant to not be moved**. Whoevew was in chawge of dis dumpstew fiwe wasn't smawt enough to figuwe dis out when dey moved dese chaiws in and out in de spwing of 2017, because now dey've put dese weiwd maxi-pad wooking swippews undew aww de wegs so dat de weight of de chaiw is spwead acwoss a wawge awea and de fwiction is decweased so dat peopwe can move awound de chaiws if dey want to. But dey'we so wawge and dewe's so many dat dewe's no way dat yuw can move dem to diffewent tabwes even if yuw wanted to. So now, peopwe have just been pushing dem fuwdew and fuwdew back fwom de centew tabwes and dey'we taking up what wittwe space dewe used to be to move dwough de awea. 

Why de in de name of fack did dey get wid of 2/3 of de staiws dat awwow yuw to get to de wowew awea, whiwe simuwtaneouswy cwowd up de main way peopwe get down dewe? Now dewe's two tiny gwass patios wif smaww cwustews

One ding I actuawwy do wike dough is de fact dat dey put desks by de wawge window. Awdough, dis awea is basicawwy uninhabitabwe fow most of de yeaw fwom wike 3PM to sunset since de sun shines diwectwy dwough dewe (which was de owiginaw intention of de window) so guess dey weawwy didn't dink dings dwough. Awso, dey wemoved most of de seating by de owiginaw entwance, so I dink it pwetty much evens out. 

## de Desks: 
dese just facking suck. dewe's no way awound it. I have **huge** quawms about one specific ding, but I'm gonna save dat fow a sepawate point. 

Fiwst of aww, de new chaiws awe aww swivew, which I pewsonawwy hate, but dats a 'me' issue. I dink most peopwe can agwee dat dey'we wowse dan de pwevious bwue itewation dough. dey awso just compwetewy fowgot about de conscious decision made in de owiginaw design to weduce neck stwain. 

de've swapped de owd desk matewiaw (actuaw wood) fow pwastic wif a wood pattewn pwinted onto it. dis may not seem wike a big deaw, but when peopwe at de next pod ovew shake deiw tabwe (incwudes dwopping textbooks, swamming deiw fist in fwustwation, ow even bumping de desk as dey push deiw chaiw in), dis shakes yuw tabwe due to de cheapew matewiaw. yuw'd dink wif 60k+ tuition fwom aww of us, dey'd be abwe to affowd de ding dat twees awe made out of, especiawwy when dewe's so many of dem in dis fwozen asshowe of a town but nope. 

Awso, dey added fwosted gwass dividews which awe asymmetwicaw. dey'we gwossy on one side and sand-bwasted on de ofew. dis means wight passes dwough diffewentwy fwom bod sides. Stupid. 

## de Chawging powts on de Desks:

My **onwy** issue wif cocktaiw befowe was de wack of chawging powts. dey made a good decision when dey decided to add powts to evewy singwe desk. Too bad dey compwetewy facked it up. Why de fack wouwd yuw put dem in de centew of de desk. *dis makes no facking sense fwom a student's pewspective*. A **wot** of peopwe wowk wif deiw waptop pushed back and have a notebook in fwont of it to take notes fwom pdf textbooks/wectuwe videos ow if dey'we some basic bitch, dey watch de Office/Fwiends (dewe awe bettew shows out dewe now, cmon) whiwe wowking. dis is impossibwe to do wif de chawging powt **sticking out of de desk**. de obvious choice is to have de powts undew de desk, but de desks by de window have de powts fwush wif de suwface which sowve dis issue, and dey stiww awe bettew dan dis gawbage. 

de wight stations at de twipwet tabwes awe even wowse. Not onwy do yuw have wess desk space to begin wif, but de outwet is facing de usew. So when yuw stick in yuw chawgew, yuw get even wess woom (neawwy hawf de widd of de desk if yuw have a fat powewbwick). dey put de USB powts on de wight of de stations, and put nofing on de weft, so not onwy is de cowd dat takes up wess woom on de side dat de outwet shouwd be on, but dey just weft *de ofew side* wif fack aww to do. 

Awso, aww of dese powts awe USB-A which, whiwe pwevawent now, wiww eventuawwy get phased out (new iPhones awe aww using USB-C). If dis wedesign is supposed to wast just as wong as de owiginaw cocktaiw wasted, yuw stawting off pwetty piss poow. 

## de New Twipwets

*Why wouwd yuw wemove de waww between de desks dat awe opposite of each ofew?* Befowe dewe used to be a nice ciwcuwaw suwface dat was cawpeted and fewt good undew de feet. Now dewe's just anofew pewson's feet, weading to *countwess* awkwawd yeshhents whewe yuw accidentawwy pway footsie wif a stwangew. de wowst pawt is, yuw can't act wike a nowmaw hooman being whenevew it happens. Since dewe's fwosted gwass between yuw and de ofew pewson, its not wike yuw can wook at dem and apowogize wif a ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. yuw just have to awkwawdwy pwetend wike neidew of yuw guys noticed. 

## de Pwintew Awea and New Couch Awea

Cocktaiw awweady has a pwobwem wif **peopwe not tweating it wike de whispew zone it is**. But wet's put a woud machine hewe, even dough dewe was awweady wike 3 of dese just 10 seconds away and see what happens. Awso, wet's put wawge seating awwangements wike dey have in de Hotewie 'wibwawy', whewe its constantwy woud, and bwissfuwwy ignowe de fact dat its hawd to shush peopwe dat awe behind a waww dats 10 feet taww, fwom 5 feet bewow. dewe's awweady a gawbage whewe peopwe can tawk and 'wowk' in couched aweas wifout tabwes cawwed Mann. 

## de Pwivate wooms

dese wewe awways poowwy insuwated due to de giant gap undew de doow, so when yuw had a gwoup of fwiends fiww one of dese up wike a cwown caw and scweam at each ofew, evewyone in de wibwawy couwd heaw evewyding. But wet's wepwace de wawws wif gwass (dat does fack aww to insuwate noise) and point and waugh as /u/EQUASHNZwKUw woses his shit. dat's de onwy pwausibwe expwanation fow dis decision - someone's dewibewatewy doing dis to piss me off.

## de Soud Entwance

dewe's pwobabwy a good weason dey shut dis entwance off 30 yeaws ago. I have no idea what it was, but I have a bunch of new ones now. When peopwe awe tawking befowe dey entew a wibwawy, dey usuawwy don't just cut off de convewsation den and dewe. dey wet it continue fow a sentence ow two and den quiet down. de ding is, dis usuawwy happened at de Main Entwance, so by de time peopwe got to Cocktaiw, dey wouwd shut de fack up. Now yuw have dis buwwshit happening in de actuaw awea whewe a ton of peopwe awe twying to do wowk. Its a convenience suwe, but how much time awe yuw weawwy saving? I don't dink its wowd de constant intewwuptions of de waiwing awawm, but dat's just my opinion. I dink most peopwe do appweciate dis change dough, so I'm putting it aww de way down hewe, whewe yuw've (hopefuwwy) stopped weading. 

## de New Badwooms:

de got wid of de gwaffiti and one of de uwinaws. dat's aww I have to say about dat. 

## Wifi Connectivity:

I don't know what de fack happened, but I've been confiwming wif ofew peopwe and it seems wike wifi connectivity has definitewy become an issue in some pwaces. Its definitewy not a bandwidd issue, since I've had issues wate at night when Cocktaiw is nowhewe neaw its fuww capacity. 

## Tw;Dw
Whoevew was in chawge of de wedesign obviouswy has a pwopensity to fack up most decisions. Most of de changes awe indefensibwy fow de wowse, and de ones dat *awe* of any utiwity come at de cost of Cocktaiw devowving into a bunch of peopwe tawking at fuww vowume and annoying evewyone ewse in de awea. Aww in aww, I'm just disappointed I waited a semestew fow dis. uwu

6687,"# I hate the new cocktail lounge 

I honestly believe that most of the new changes made to the Cocktail Lounge were deliberately made specifically to piss **me** off. I get that this is a much less popular opinion than ""The Cornell Daily Sun is a garbage publication"" but I HAVE TO get this shit off my chest (and really, really don't feel like doing StatMech).

Everything about the old cocktail lounge was *perfect*. I spent more time in Cocktail than in my own home during my sophomore year. The blue mini-couches that you could put side by side to create the perfect sleeping pod, the chairs were at the perfect height so you wouldn't strain your neck after 12 hours of work, and the sloped foot areas in the islands and two-seaters were great. Now look at this god-forsaken mess. If you're new to the subreddit or a freshman, you're in for a ride, I'm about to do what I do best: bitch and moan like a 16 year old teen on reality television as an excuse to avoid doing work. 

## The Central Lounge:
You know what I'm talking about. The area where cocktail 'bends'. They used to have the comfiest seats on campus. I get why they decided to swap out the old chairs (if they aren't on sale anymore, and I'm pretty sure they haven't been cleaned since the 80s), but the new purchases are just fucking stupid. 

With all the new furniture, its virtually impossible to get through this area without bumping into someone and getting a rude glare, or cutting through their seating area and awkwardly tripping over a power cord. The tall chairs are also sore on the eyes. The whole area is just so... crowded. 

Also, one of the main advantages of the old chairs was that they were relatively mobile. You could move them around and people often did, moving them from table to table. These new ones are ridiculously large and **are obviously meant to not be moved**. Whoever was in charge of this dumpster fire wasn't smart enough to figure this out when they moved these chairs in and out in the spring of 2017, because now they've put these weird maxi-pad looking slippers under all the legs so that the weight of the chair is spread across a large area and the friction is decreased so that people can move around the chairs if they want to. But they're so large and there's so many that there's no way that you can move them to different tables even if you wanted to. So now, people have just been pushing them further and further back from the center tables and they're taking up what little space there used to be to move through the area. 

Why the in the name of fuck did they get rid of 2/3 of the stairs that allow you to get to the lower area, while simultaneously crowd up the main way people get down there? Now there's two tiny glass patios with small clusters

One thing I actually do like though is the fact that they put desks by the large window. Although, this area is basically uninhabitable for most of the year from like 3PM to sunset since the sun shines directly through there (which was the original intention of the window) so guess they really didn't think things through. Also, they removed most of the seating by the original entrance, so I think it pretty much evens out. 

## The Desks: 
These just fucking suck. There's no way around it. I have **huge** qualms about one specific thing, but I'm gonna save that for a separate point. 

First of all, the new chairs are all swivel, which I personally hate, but thats a 'me' issue. I think most people can agree that they're worse than the previous blue iteration though. They also just completely forgot about the conscious decision made in the original design to reduce neck strain. 

The've swapped the old desk material (actual wood) for plastic with a wood pattern printed onto it. This may not seem like a big deal, but when people at the next pod over shake their table (includes dropping textbooks, slamming their fist in frustration, or even bumping the desk as they push their chair in), this shakes your table due to the cheaper material. You'd think with 60k+ tuition from all of us, they'd be able to afford the thing that trees are made out of, especially when there's so many of them in this frozen asshole of a town but nope. 

Also, they added frosted glass dividers which are asymmetrical. They're glossy on one side and sand-blasted on the other. This means light passes through differently from both sides. Stupid. 

## The Charging ports on the Desks:

My **only** issue with cocktail before was the lack of charging ports. They made a good decision when they decided to add ports to every single desk. Too bad they completely fucked it up. Why the fuck would you put them in the center of the desk. *This makes no fucking sense from a student's perspective*. A **lot** of people work with their laptop pushed back and have a notebook in front of it to take notes from pdf textbooks/lecture videos or if they're some basic bitch, they watch The Office/Friends (there are better shows out there now, cmon) while working. This is impossible to do with the charging port **sticking out of the desk**. The obvious choice is to have the ports under the desk, but the desks by the window have the ports flush with the surface which solve this issue, and they still are better than this garbage. 

The light stations at the triplet tables are even worse. Not only do you have less desk space to begin with, but the outlet is facing the user. So when you stick in your charger, you get even less room (nearly half the width of the desk if you have a fat powerbrick). They put the USB ports on the right of the stations, and put nothing on the left, so not only is the cord that takes up less room on the side that the outlet should be on, but they just left *the other side* with fuck all to do. 

Also, all of these ports are USB-A which, while prevalent now, will eventually get phased out (new iPhones are all using USB-C). If this redesign is supposed to last just as long as the original cocktail lasted, you're starting off pretty piss poor. 

## The New Triplets

*Why would you remove the wall between the desks that are opposite of each other?* Before there used to be a nice circular surface that was carpeted and felt good under the feet. Now there's just another person's feet, leading to *countless* awkward moments where you accidentally play footsie with a stranger. The worst part is, you can't act like a normal human being whenever it happens. Since there's frosted glass between you and the other person, its not like you can look at them and apologize with a ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. You just have to awkwardly pretend like neither of you guys noticed. 

## The Printer Area and New Couch Area

Cocktail already has a problem with **people not treating it like the whisper zone it is**. But let's put a loud machine here, even though there was already like 3 of these just 10 seconds away and see what happens. Also, let's put large seating arrangements like they have in the Hotelie 'Library', where its constantly loud, and blissfully ignore the fact that its hard to shush people that are behind a wall thats 10 feet tall, from 5 feet below. There's already a garbage where people can talk and 'work' in couched areas without tables called Mann. 

## The Private Rooms

These were always poorly insulated due to the giant gap under the door, so when you had a group of friends fill one of these up like a clown car and scream at each other, everyone in the library could hear everything. But let's replace the walls with glass (that does fuck all to insulate noise) and point and laugh as /u/EQUASHNZRKUL loses his shit. That's the only plausible explanation for this decision - someone's deliberately doing this to piss me off.

## The South Entrance

There's probably a good reason they shut this entrance off 30 years ago. I have no idea what it was, but I have a bunch of new ones now. When people are talking before they enter a library, they usually don't just cut off the conversation then and there. They let it continue for a sentence or two and then quiet down. The thing is, this usually happened at the Main Entrance, so by the time people got to Cocktail, they would shut the fuck up. Now you have this bullshit happening in the actual area where a ton of people are trying to do work. Its a convenience sure, but how much time are you really saving? I don't think its worth the constant interruptions of the wailing alarm, but that's just my opinion. I think most people do appreciate this change though, so I'm putting it all the way down here, where you've (hopefully) stopped reading. 

## The New Bathrooms:

The got rid of the graffiti and one of the urinals. That's all I have to say about that. 

## Wifi Connectivity:

I don't know what the fuck happened, but I've been confirming with other people and it seems like wifi connectivity has definitely become an issue in some places. Its definitely not a bandwidth issue, since I've had issues late at night when Cocktail is nowhere near its full capacity. 

## TL;DR
Whoever was in charge of the redesign obviously has a propensity to fuck up most decisions. Most of the changes are indefensibly for the worse, and the ones that *are* of any utility come at the cost of Cocktail devolving into a bunch of people talking at full volume and annoying everyone else in the area. All in all, I'm just disappointed I waited a semester for this.",0.0584,0.1956,0.746

6812,"In case you are serious somehow, I can point out something you're missing. As efficiency in the market increase through invention or optimization, the resources required to produce the same amount of value lowers. This would naturally produce deflation. This was one of the original purposes of the fed, to manage the currency, and that's where inflation ""targets"" came from. They have to introduce a certain amount of new currency or deflation happens, and there's a lesser known spiral that happens where people would rather save than invest, because while investing is risky, saving means profit. And you can already see the dispreportion from technology, in the fact that technology price deflation outpaces everything else. It not only produces the most automation, but is also the most receptive processes TO automation. So many times now, it's worth it to wait a year or two and buy the same tech for 1/2 the price. The 13MP camera will still take pictures clear enough to enjoy on a large screen, etc. But how is this new money put into the system? It's loaned out through the banks and lending institutions / mechanisms right, so somebody get's the money ""for free"" in the time-cost of money sense. They lend it out at the future's exchange rate so to speak, and when the money is inflated, they should have already been paid back with interest (for which people's savings are automatically devalued) and then they zero out the account. All UBI would be doing is changing the origin point for new money. The curve over time would be to where the time when everything can be created for virtually free, is when the GDP divided by the population = the amount given out divided by the number of steps in production (because value add exchanges would be facilitated by the same injection currency). The question isn't where we get the money, but whether the place where all new currency get's their value, the increase in efficiency and technology of the means of production, is increased to a rate where this is justified or not. And it has been for the last probably 10-20 years, this is why we didn't see any crazy inflation. It's finally been happening the last year or so, but nowhere near as rapidly as it should have considering the amount of new money they've pumped into the system. Think about it. Would it make sense to have fully automated businesses with no customers? What's all this for if not to provide for the needs of mankind? But you can't do it until you have automation because the losses system wide are too high. We're now at the point where people are sitting in offices secretly checking reddit and facebook etc because the amount of effort we all have to exert to ""earn"" the stuff coming out of the factories is so damn low, and yet we have all these old structures in place and people have to go through the Theater of Work to pay their rent.

6954,"I'd disagree with the poster above. Having held a few low-level positions in clubs at Cornell, I wish I had been more committed to extracurriculars. Most club leadership experience that involves some sort of real effort like event planning, recruiting, interviewing, fundraising, research, making actual products, etc. looks really good on a resume. Someone with a 3.5 GPA and lots of extracurricular experience is going to do a lot better with finding a job than someone with a 4.0 who studied all the time. But even though academic/research/project clubs may seem more impressive, I think employers are intrigued by people who have leadership positions in things that are different from their academic interests. It shows that you put in the effort because you care, not because it looks good. 

My advice to OP would be to keep looking for more clubs to join, club fair isn't a deadline, and ask friends what orgs they're involved in. Maybe try to find a social justice type org that does stuff for the Ithaca community rather than just 'awareness' type stuff?

7271,"**To Arch. Majors: A few questions from an applicant**

Not a chance me, I don't think I'd like to know my odds just yet.

Hello, I'm a senior that is most likely applying to Cornell ED. Some background: My school offers a lot of math and science classes, and so I've taken some accelerated math courses (from pre calc up to Calc AB), and I really got into physics (AP 2, C Mechanics &amp; EM), but I'm also part of the design major at my school. So I'm really passionate about art and design, and I wanna see if I can expand that passion into Architecture here. Anyway:

1. What's it like paying for a five-year course? Is it significantly more challenging than a traditional four years?
2. Any small things that makes you think arch stands out at Cornell? I've heard so pretty good things, but I'd like to hear some firsthand experiences
3. Do you love what you do as an arch major?

Thanks, and sorry if these questions are annoying. To be honest, I'm teetering between EP and AAP. I feel like AAP would be a fit for me as someone who's also into design, and I'd have a way to stand out between the applicants as opposed to going to EP. But an architecture education also seems quite an expensive investment, and if that's the case I wanna know if it's doable or if I'd have a good return. Thanks you guys.",0.4299,0.4529,0.1172

7278,"I think I have a satisfactory explanation as to why I want to go to Cornell (I want to work with a specific researcher in their lab and take classes there that aren’t offered in other schools like SFSU, UCLA, etc). 

Some personal reasons as to why I want to transfer (which I’m not listing in my essays) are that Cornell’s the only school I’m interested in that offers a spring admission and that I want to get out of SFSU as soon as possible. Imo there isn’t any competition (I don’t mean that in a condescending way; there’s just no atmosphere of competitiveness), which I feel like I need to keep up my motivation to pursue medicine. It’s kinda hard to want to keep doing well when a lot of students are “C’s get degrees” people. 

I also feel like I’m maxing out at my current school. I’ve taken advantage of a lot of opportunities (the only ones I haven’t taken advantage of would require me to stay for two more years, and I do not want to do that at all). 

I think this school was great for finding my love for medicine; but, this school is holding me back. They’ve delayed my graduation because of numerous reasons (main one is being unable to get classes). The situation is so widespread that we don’t even have “junior” or “senior” status bc people don’t graduate in four years (22% 4 yr grad rate).

I could list a bunch more reasons that aren’t in my essay but they’re really just personal ones I could technically live with.

As for the SAT, I’m not going to submit it since they don’t require it. I’ve shown my essay to a couple of students who are in Yale, Columbia, and NYU and they’ve said good things about it; but I’m still going to work on them until the submission deadline.

Service hours include helping out with stuff like philanthropy events and apple fest, or even things as simple as finger knitting scarves for local homeless people or passing out candy to cheer people up before rough prelims. And all of the service events have an air of camaraderie as well. 

Because the frat is so large there’s nearly always something going on (as in nearly every hour of every day), and members can host any social event they want without permission or get volunteers to help with their own service initiatives just by asking service team for permission.

As an experience designer, one of the first things I consider is the intent vs the usage per the population, and my take on Cornell is that students will take any opportunity for self-improvement extremely seriously, even if it's supposed to be casual.

One way to undermine seriousness is to ironically over-apply seriousness and rigor to silly things. So what about a club that's all about cake, and the enjoyment of said cake is exceptionally parliamentarian? One writes satirical reviews of cake (all of which must end with a score of 11/10, with the justification of ""because cake is awesome.""), and then puts the cake review up to the Cake Committee for approval (overwhelmingly approved every time, ""because cake is awesome."").

The strike tone, strike note, or tap note, of a bell when struck is the dominant note perceived immediately by the human ear. It is also known as the prime or fundamental note. However, an analysis of the bell's frequency spectrum reveals that the fundamental only exists weakly and its dominance is a human perception of a note built up by the complex series of harmonics that are generated. The correct harmonic tuning of the bell is therefore important in creating a good strike tone.

I think that if you have a good background and are willing to put in the time, it will not affect you adversely in a huge way to skip to 2218. While 1116 is a great course to get into physics, 2217 is largely repeated in AEP 3550 and you can do without it. That being said, if at all possible I do recommend you to take at least one of 2217 or 1116 because they are really good courses to have under your belt before you do the upper-division equivalents and will help you to do physics better generally. Many people do not take these courses, and still do fine in physics, however.

It’s pretty difficult to get out of Ithaca, you have to rent a car or go by bus or plane but any way it’s multiple hours of travel to get anywhere- though people do leave on the occasional weekend, many stay on campus 24/7

However it is a really gorgeous campus, if you like hiking, camping, and the outdoors, it’s a great place for that, just find friends with cars or like walking a lot.

As for finding a community- while you cannot stay in sorority houses (you have to rush (google it) to get into them), you can stay in dorms at risley or west, or in a program house (mostly freshman), all which have fun programming year-round (but again, a lot of people are too busy to attend)

Have a request? Go up and let them know! If it’s a popular song, it’s probably in the database. However, some are only available as duets, May be too hard to sightread, or a Chimesmaster may not have room in their planned concert for it.

It is absolutely inappropriate to speak about Hinduism from a purely historical perspective. It's not a dead religion like Greek and Roman pantheism, it's a living way of life with a massive legendarium of mythology and philosophy alike.

7779,"In contrast to what ThoughtUWereSmaller is saying, you should probably think about housing sometime soon. On campus housing is significantly more expensive than most off-campus housing, and a lot of on-campus housing is pretty shit. You deserve better than paying $1500 a month for a 300 sq foot room that you have to share with a roommate. The best-case scenario for on-campus housing is worse than what you could get off-campus for the same cost.

You can find apartments in a number of ways. The various housing companies have websites showing their houses and apartments. You can also get a group of friends together and tour around Ithaca to see what houses are for rent- many houses are owned by small landlords with only a few properties, and you'll need to call them to set up tours and learn about the property. This will be a fair bit of work. The other option is that if you're in a club, often people from the club will rent a home together- various band instruments have houses, as do several of the improv and theater. A last option which a lot of people try to go for is to join a coop, which provide housing for much cheaper than on-campus housing.",0.107,0.3968,0.4963

Definitely can't live in a Frat/Sorority that is on the list of conditions as an exchange student. Not that you're likely to get the opportunity to anyway.  


Meeting people was OK. I lived in a house with a few people and there were events to help socialise with other exchange students. If you're personable it's quite easy to meet people. Travelling is almost impossible without a car. Ithaca has an airport but flights are pricey 5 hour bus journey to NYC is ok. But you can also spend time there at beginning/end of your semester.

7871,"Because when you're sick your brain doesn't work as well as it normally does. Many, many studies have shown that being sick impairs cognition for a variety of reasons. 1) When you're sick, your body generally tries to expend resources (energy) on fighting off the infection. Given the fact that your brain is one of the biggest glucose sinks in your body, the amount of energy that is going to be available to it is going to be cut down so that you can ward off the germs. The same energy conservation is also why sick people generally have such poor appetites; it's their bodies' way of attempting to get them to conserve energy used to digest food to instead be used for an immune response. 2) Lots of pro-inflammatory and signalling molecules released in an immune response (i.e. cytokines) will actually acutely impair cognition. People who are really, really sick are regularly delirious for this reason.

**SAT**: 1480 in one sitting

**College ECs**: Teaching assistant for multiple CS courses

Teach weekly high school health classes under a volunteer program affiliated with my school

Intern in IT department at a well known hospital (originally worked on a team project there under an internship program geared towards women in tech, but then it became extended to a regular internship)

Currently taking preparatory steps towards AI-related research under a professor at my school; not sure how far I'll specifically get with this within the next month, but hopefully will be actually involved in the lab next month

Recently interviewed for my school's selective interdisciplinary honors program - 90% sure I'll be accepted, so I'm listing it here.

And some volunteer work at an activist archive

**Recommendations:** Two from well-established people at the hospital, which I believe will be probably be the best (one of these people in particular still references our project constantly and is extremely enthusiastic about it). Three professor recs - one CS, two humanities since CS courses are really impersonal at my school - not totally positive as to how these will turn out, but I'm assuming they will be rather strong as I really excelled in these courses.

**High school info**: Not going to bother listing high school EC's since they weren't anything spectacular, but I won a national gold medal for my writing (received by &lt;700/300,000 people). My situation was a bit complicated. I started off with a great average at a really prestigious/competitive HS, then switched to homeschool due to health reasons; I had a great course load and prepared for close to 10 AP exams, but was unable to take them because although I was approved for medical accommodation for standardized testing, I was unfortunately unable to actually receive it -- which I plan on mentioning somewhere. I do feel like having an unconventional background followed by success in college might help though?

8040,"I'm not an ILR student, but I can at least answer some of your questions.

1. Advantages: Lots of funding and resources, meeting other smart and motivated students, strong campus community, beautiful natural environment, limitless research opportunities, lots of campus societies/ activities, huge career fairs, famous and accomplished professors, big Ivy League name. Disadvantages: Large, less personal research-oriented university, cold and dark climate, isolated from the social and professional resources of a city, pretty competitive very pre-professional environment, weirdly expensive housing.
2. There are no ""guaranteed"" internship opportunities that I know of. However, if you are motivated and start looking early, you should have no problem finding internships.
3. I haven't heard of any particular disadvantage related to this major. I guess it depends on what type of job you are interested in. You can see where ILR students work after graduation [here](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/ILR_CS_BachelorsDataBrochure_Final_2.pdf).
4. In [the survey that I posted above](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/ILR_CS_BachelorsDataBrochure_Final_2.pdf), you can see the graduate programs that ILR students attend. I cannot comment on which actually receive the most students. 
5. Not really sure what you mean by this. Does Cornell work to improve the welfare of its students? There are extensive mental health services, but you will need to reach out yourself. It is easy to become isolated in a such a big school, and if you do not build a friend group, there is no one looking out for you. You must be proactive with regard to your own health and well-being.

I don't know which class or which professor you're referring to, but I've always found my professors in the humanities departments to be nuanced, sophisticated, and thoughtful. Your polemical characterization of this specific Professor as being thoughtless and careless in his discussion of colonialism seems rather unlikely IMO, given that you can't even get away with that kind of thinking as an undergrad.

8065,"While I don't think someone going into academia on a culture not their own is bad thing, there certainly needs to be some nuance when doing so. I think anyone can agree with that.

That being said, your question should then be, why aren't there south asian professors teaching south asian history? I think you may find that it's not because Cornell only looks for white dudes.

A much more articulate explanation may also be because asian and south asian immigrants tend to push their kids more towards STEM/'this will make you money' studies and away from history/the arts while white families really don't give a fuck. There is statistical evidence that suggests this is True. One explanation as to why is that first generation immigrant families want their children to be financial secure and successful, and a history degree doesn't really give you that. The asian/south asian demographic has the highest median income in America and them picking STEM over History academia is one of the reasons why. 

____________________________________

&gt;Also, like how the hell do you talk about my religion like it came out of a textbook

There are muslim scholars who study Christianity, and vice versa, etc, etc.

It does come out of a textbook. Christianity, Buddhism, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, &lt;insert another here&gt; all have very definitive (to a degree) histories and their impact on local, regional, and global cultures can be objectively discussed.

&gt;Like how don't you have a single professor that is some color of brown (other than the ones who teach the language). This isn't okay because it means that history is being written by white people. That isn't okay.

No it doesn't. In this case it means that indians/indian americans are not pursuing history. Nobody is pursuing history, really - white people are just the largest demographic in america so naturally you will have more white history people.

&gt;But then, there was this white prof wearing a mala (aka a flower garland). I literally blew my shits seeing that. We put malas on our GODS, or like brides or people who die. No ordinary person wears a mala.

The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical reader's head. There's also the student body's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- our collective philosophy draws heavily from Pearson literature, for instance. The faculty understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about BIG RED. As a consequence people who dislike r/Cornell truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in our existential catchphrase ""stop coughing on me,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Cornell Heath's epic inability to be useful. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of you addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Martha Pollock's genius wit unfolds itself on your computer screens.

Is it slightly overused? Yes. No one's arguing that.

As someone who is a internet user who studies memes, I am telling you, specifically, on reddit, no one calls the navy seals copypasta B+. If you want to claim ""needs improvement"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. You're disrespecting an iconic meme.

If you're saying ""B+"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Instagram Memes, which includes things from r/dankmemes and r/deepfriedmemes.

So your reasoning for calling a copypasta B+ is because redditors often use the original copypasta. Let's get r/highqualitygifs and r/emojipasta in there, then, too.

Also, calling something a dank or a meme? It's not one or the other, that's not how the internet works. They're both. A meme is a meme and a member of the dank family. But that's not what you said. You said a dank meme is B+, which is not True unless you're okay with calling all memes of the dank family B+, which means you'd call ""people's roommates jerking off in fursuits, ... telling a professor to fuck themselves in the comments, and ... deeply racist bus drivers"", too.

Cornel Ronald West (born June 2, 1953) is an American philosopher, political activist, social critic, author, and public intellectual. 

The son of a Baptist minister, West focuses on the role of race, gender, and class in American society and the means by which people act and react to their ""radical conditionedness"". A radical democrat and democratic socialist, West draws intellectual contributions from multiple traditions, including Christianity, the black church, Marxism, neopragmatism, and transcendentalism. Among his most influential books are Race Matters (1994) and Democracy Matters (2004).

Jane and Leland Stanford modeled their university after the great eastern universities, most specifically Cornell University.

Both Cornell and Stanford were among the first to have higher education be accessible, nonsectarian, and open to women as well as to men. Cornell is credited as one of the first American universities to adopt this radical departure from traditional education, and Stanford became an early adopter as well.[57]",0.568,0.4288,0.0032

Intended major: Animal Science (CALS)
Intended minor that I’m mentioning in my essay: Climate Change 

Ethnicity/Gender: White/Asian Female (from Nevada)

Weighted GPA: 4.629

Unweighted GPA: 3.829 (might change after first semester, lower or higher)

Class rank: 42/751 (average competitive level, public HS)

ACT: 31, 33 superscore but their superscore policy is a little unclear 

SAT II: 760 Biology E and 680 on Math 2 which I plan on retaking, don’t feel good about it though... it’s on Saturday

APs: I was not the best at the exams lol
* World History (3)
* Biology (3)
* Lang (3)
* US History (2)
* Psychology (5) 

Senior APs: Making 9 in total

* Gonna self study Environmental Science
* Calculus AB
* French Lang &amp; Culture
* Government
* IB Literature

Essays/Recs: 
* Counselor: 9.5/10 She talked me through it and I think it’s going to be good. She’s impressed with my resume and knows what to highlight.
* AP Bio teacher: 8-9/10 She’s probably the only teacher I’ve ever gotten close with, although not super close, I still felt the most comfortable around her. She also majored in what I want to major in! 
* APUSH teacher: 6/10 I didn’t really know who else to ask, but he’s very nice and I assume he’s a good writer
* Tennis coach: 9/10 She knows me and she is well-spoken IMO, but because she’s an extra rather than a teacher I don’t know how helpful it’ll be. 
* Personal essay: 9/10 It’s about my social anxiety but I think I have a good story in mind (I have to fix a lot after showing it to my English teacher and family) and I’ll get a lot of feedback.
* Cornell essay: 9.5/10 I’m definitely going to prioritize this one and I’ve written my first draft but I am going to change a lot so that it’s more about Cornell wanting me rather than me wanting Cornell.

Extracurriculars: pretty basic and most not long term...
* 4 years varsity track (will be) - only award I got was most improved, but that was given by my coach
* 3 years varsity tennis (joined sophomore year)
* Years 6-10 Orchestra - we played at a national conference in Chicago which required auditions, don't know if this is worth saying or not
* Private violin lessons for 2 years
* Private piano lessons for 4/5 years
* HOSA (STEM club) for 1 year, no awards or special positions
* Vegan club for 1 year, just a member
* Animal Advocate club freshman year and now senior year
* NHS, going on my second year - volunteered at a book prep place which cleaned up donated books, for my individual hours. This year I’ll be volunteering with an animal rescue organization to help with adoption events. 
* VP of French Club, first year in this club 
* Recently joined Best Buddies club 

Summer activities: these were both short and I don't know if it's worth anything, but I've never had a part-time or summer job.
* 2 weeks at a language camp in Paris 
* 2 weeks volunteering at a wildlife orphanage in Zimbabwe

If you get good at this, you'll be able to attack any problem that could possibly be thrown at you on the prelim by taking your time to completely understand what is being asked of you.

For problems that are more about evaluating statements (i.e. True/False), just be sure to know the basic definitions of all of the concepts, and how they can apply to each other. Given enough time and patience, you should be able to answer any question about the concepts introduced so far just by thinking carefully about the definitions, and thinking about them in whatever way suits you best (drawing diagrams, etc.).

For anyone who fell for the scam and paid her with a credit card, don't worry, your info probably isn't stolen (that would be an actually serious crime that wouldn't operate so brazenly). Still, I suggest filing a chargeback when the transaction goes through, even if it was for a small amount because:

8743,"Hi, just wanted to provide some insight as I was in a somewhat similar situation my freshman year. So I didn't have one specific project team I wanted to be on, but I got rejected by every single one I applied to. My sister came to Cornell to, and she ended up being the project team lead for one of the more prestigious project teams by her junior year. When I came in I was expecting the same thing to happen to me, where I would get on a project team and in like a year or two become promoted to a lead. Instead, my freshman year I watched all of my friends get into their favorite project teams while I got rejection after rejection. As a third year now, I have to say that project teams are not everything you expect them to be. A lot of people drop project teams after freshman year and still end up fine. My advice to you is to keep your head up and make the most of your freshman year anyway. I made the mistake of letting imposter syndrome get the best of me and did very few extracurriculars my freshman year. I recommend you try out other things and try to get as much technical experience as you can. And again, you can always apply next semester or next fall. Good luck in the rest of your freshman year :)",0.2262,0.4858,0.288

You need to integrate from 1/D (substitute D into the function 1/x because the x bounds are 1 to D) to 1 first, which gives you the volume of only the outer revolved portion of the horn.

I'm not sure how helpful my advice would be on the latter half of your post, but I guess  dont tell them (ofc) that you're not sure if you want this position. Worst case scenario, you get the position and realize its not for you, and change the course of what you wanna do afterwards from then on. If you tell them or show them your uncertainty, you wont get the opportunity to try it at all.  


From reading other subreddits about career and stuff: the answer to your second question is probably not in the long run. but if the career you really want is vastly different than what you get your coop in, it might just put you behind a little.  


Considering its engineering, you'll probably be fine. theres lots of overlap with different eng fields, and if anything it might make you seem like a more diverse candidate with good skills.

For reference, the quizzes we had were \~15min on material not really related to the hw, at the beginning of recitations, dunno if they're the same in your class.

I'm not sure i can give much advice on taking quizzes, but general advice such as work on hw with others and attend OH/study halls is pretty much the key. While it is certainly valuable to struggle through physics problems on your own, remember that every hour spent getting stuck on one problem is an hour you can't use to learn other material -- if you're stuck on a problem in an ""unproductive"" way, i.e. really at a dead end, it's much better to get help.

It’s really impressive considering the size of the department. Civil engineering as a whole is small in terms of numbers compared to some of the other engineering majors, but it honestly feels a lot bigger.

There are also some really nice perks of studying Civil Engineering within the context of Cornell as a whole. For one, CEE also has environmental engineering opportunities, so it’s pretty easy to get involved in that should you choose. CALS naturally also has a lot of environmental stuff going on too. I believe you can also take some classes through AAP (architecture, art, and planning), if that interests you. There’s also a business minor made for engineers, as well as a co-op program. Also, it’s possible to start your M. Eng here early, so you save on tuition and get a masters in only one semester after graduation.

I know a few civil engineering graduates and it’s worked out pretty well for them. Alumni panels I’ve been to have also been pretty positive. It’s hard to really go wrong with a degree in civil engineering in general, but Cornell does seem to set you up pretty well.",0.9737,0.024,0.0023

The acceptance rates are pretty low for any individual  team, but if you do your research and apply to a bunch there’s a good chance you’ll get something. I’d say as a whole the CS ones tend to be more competitive just because they require a certain degree of technical skill, and because there’s so many CS majors. Some of the ones that have cool things to show off (ie mars rover, Baja, and AUV) also tend to be a bit more competitive because they naturally have pretty good marketing and drive a lot of people to apply.

9175,"I have ADHD too, and while yours sounds a bit worse than mine, I do have some coping strategies that might help:

-Use some sort of planner to write down all your tasks. Preferably one on your phone so you’re less likely to lose it. In the past I’ve used the notes app, Elisi, P. schedule, and Google Calendar. Every assignment and exam listed on the syllabus goes into your planner app at the beginning of the semester and then you’re set. This may take a couple hours but it’s so worth it. Then, add all your classes and extracurriculars to your calendar. Then, if you know you have a meeting add that too. Finally, the night before add in time for meals, homework etc. You don’t have to rigidly stuck to the schedule you make (you probably won’t), but it helps you see how much time you have to work with and it makes you be more mindful of when you should be working.

-Everything you will need that week is always in your backpack. So for example even if you have a MWF binder and a TuTh binder, always have both in your backpack unless you’re actively studying from them. When you’re done studying they go right back in your backpack. Only need your i-clicker once a week? Doesn’t matter, it stays in your backpack at all times. Same with your calculator.

-You need multiple copies of anything you need both at home and at class, as much as possible. One pencil case is for class, but you need separate pens for your desk or wherever you do work at home. Having to take your pencil case out of your backpack means you’re more likely to forget it. Also with phone chargers. One for your backpack, one for at home, and one for your purse if you’re a girl.

-Keep things you use together together. E.g. store your laptop charger in your laptop case.  

-For things you can’t have two of or need to take out at home like binders, notebooks, expensive calculators etc, try to always return them to your backpack before going to sleep. This helps minimize your chances of forgetting them.

-On that note, do as much as possible the night before. Pack your backpack, set out your clothes, shower etc. If I have to do more than roll out of bed, get dressed, and brush my teeth in the morning I’ll usually be late to class. If you’re not on a meal plan pack your lunch the night before. And pack your utensils in your backpack the night before because you’ll forget those too. 

-Consider taking class notes on your computer. You are much less likely to forget or misplace your laptop than individual notebooks for each class. People say your retention is better on paper but for me I get distracted if I have to try to write everything by hand. Also your effective retention is 0 if you lose your notebook lmao.

-Most people with ADHD have a comorbid sleep disorder because they don’t produce cortisol and melatonin in the proper quantities or at the right time. I recommend taking melatonin supplements if you have trouble sleeping. I take 1-3mg one hour before I want to sleep that night. It helps quiet my brain enough to sleep. People say to take it at the same time every night to “reset” your circadian rhythm but yours is probably permanently fucked anyway so just take it whenever and leave it enough time to work. For me it works almost like a sleeping pill.

-Finally, KNOW AND ACCEPT YOUR LIMITS. Even with all those coping mechanisms, there are certain things about me I know I can’t change. They suck but there’s no point in beating myself up about them. 

—For example, I don’t take classes before 10:10 unless 1000% necessary because I know I’ll sleep through them or be exhausted all day. I also don’t take classes with mandatory attendance before noon, again unless it can’t be avoided. 

—I also try to get as long as I can into the semester before I start skipping classes because it’s hard to stop once you start.

—Some classes you will always be late to. As long as they don’t take attendance you may just have to live with it. I was 15 minutes late to genetics EVERY DAY, and I still got an A. That said, I’m way more likely to be late to my first class, so try to make your first class one that doesn’t take attendance. 

—If you keep losing one thing in particular, can you go without it? I will never be able to keep track of an umbrella, so I just use a long raincoat and high boots. Does this suck? Yes. Is it better than dropping $100 per winter on $20 umbrellas? Also yes.

—I can’t pay full attention if I’m kind of bored in class and don’t need to actively be taking notes but do need to passively listen (like in a humanities class). In those cases I doodle or play 2048 on my laptop so I can still pay attention without spacing out.

—If you have an iphone use the screentime function to block reddit and other apps you use to procrastinate during classtime. You can still choose to use them in 15 minute increments, but the screen that pops up is enough to keep me from mindlessly opening it during class. Never leave anything to self control if you can help it. You and I have much less than most people, so don’t waste it on things you can outsource.

—Many stereotypical productivity tools may not work for you, and that’s ok. Like I suck at the pomodoro technique because the 5 minute breaks become 30 minute breaks. It’s easier for me to just work until I can’t concentrate and then take a much longer break.

—Know what you procrastinate and try to pre-empt it. I procrastinate showering and cooking so I shower as soon as I get home and do all my cooking for the week on the weekend. 

—Procrastinate productively. It’s ok if you don’t wanna write your essay due Tuesday and would much rather start your math homework that isn’t due until Friday. Just make sure you’re getting work done, if the alternative is to do nothing (which for me it often would be). You can get the essay done when the looming dread of it being due tomorrow gets your adrenaline pumping, and then at least you can go to bed early Tuesday after your all-nighter because your later homework is already done.

Ultimately though, I still need medication to spend long blocks studying or doing homework efficiently. And I will be useless in a lab class without my meds. But I don’t take them unless I need them, so I still use all of those coping strategies basically every day. 

Sorry for this absolute novel. I’m slightly procrastinating right now. But let me know if you have any questions about these. These are the result of years of being unmedicated and having to figure shit out. My GPA the semesters I was unmedicated was around 3.2 and now I get 3.8+ every semester, though, so just know that you’ll probably be able to improve a lot once you get meds sorted out!",0.2816,0.5601,0.1583

Long term, things that have helped most have been developing more coping tools, heavily helped along by reading tips and tricks from other adhd people. 

One thing i needed in every class was a physical repetitive motion to do, which would keep me awake and able to hear the lecture and take notes. Usually i knit or crocheted something simple. Sometimes i spun yarn. Without these additional stimulus, I'd just fall over at the desk and sleep through lectures.

Simple answer: don't put yourself in a situation that feels like how you do now.

Please, please, believe me when I say this: many people are having a hard time and they don't talk about it or they hide it and pretend they're having a good time. People here LOVE to try to make you think they're thriving, but trust me, if they were so confident in their happiness and success, they wouldn't feel the need to show it off would they? DM me if you want to chat, and hang in there. Clubs at cornell are groups organized and led by students, not professionals, not professors with PhDs, but basically kids. Yes, we're all 18+, but come on, we're not real adults yet. We have no qualifications to fairly assess who belongs on a team and who doesn't. Someone I know who got onto a project team told me that he found out the reason he got on was because their financial subteam needed someone very specific and he coincidentally happened to have the skills they needed. These clubs on campus want to improve their ranking and prestige by getting as many people to apply as possible, so they make everybody think they have a chance at getting in, and they say stuff like ""omg we totally want you even if you're in \_\_\_ major and you have no experience with \_\_\_!"" even if they actually don't want you at all. A lot of clubs on campus are cirlce jerks for people to feel good about themselves and they're literally harder to get into than getting into Stanford. So please, believe me, it's okay!!! There's so much more to like about Cornell. If it's something you're interested in, consider getting into a dry lab and working with a professor.

Aside from some improvements around the edges they aren’t fundamentally all that different than the original multilayer perceptron proposed in the 60s. 

Deep learning is really good at feature extraction - figuring out the relevant features in the data, like what makes different breeds of dogs or makes and models of cars identifiable, instead of a human having to define what those features are by hand - but they also have drawbacks. They take a lot of data and computing power to be useful, and there are cases where you want your model to be expressive, meaning that you can trace back the decision process. One example would be spam filtering: a naive Bayes classifier will tell you what words in emails are most likely to be influential in tagging an email as spam (like “viagara”). Medical decision making is also an area where you want to understand the decision process of the system; you really don’t want to trust your medical practice to a computer that basically says “give patient A medicine B, don’t ask why.” A neural network will just give you a bunch of weight vectors which don’t mean anything on their own.

I saw all of Kilian’s 4780 videos last year and am in the current course offering, and honestly it just comes down to compatible learning styles. Kilian is all math on a blackboard with the occasional demo, whereas Thorsten/Nika’s instruction style seems to focus on building an intuitive understanding of ML topics that lead towards a mathematical understanding, rather than the other way around. 

If Thorsten/Nika’s approach makes more sense to you, go to lecture or watch the posted videos on Mediasite. If you prefer Kilian’s style, watch his lectures on YouTube. 

Ultimately, the conclusions are roughly the same for both. Machine learning as a whole hasn’t really changed all that much over the past couple years, let alone couple decades.

* open doc/set up formatting &amp; title
* outline paper
* write section 1
* write section 2

etc. until you would be done with the paper. This really helps me get started on work that seems daunting or like it would take a lot of concentration for a long time, because usually getting started is the hardest part. I use [todoist](https://todoist.com) to make to-do lists for each day of the week. It's really user friendly, it allows you to prioritize things on the list (as high, med, low), and it's super easy to move/schedule tasks for different days and times. It can be auto-synced to google calendar (which I would also recommend using). It motivates you to set/meet productivity goals by rewarding you with points. 

Also, usually ADHD people can hyper-focus on things that they're interested in, so if it's possible for you to take classes that you actually care about or pick topics for assignments that you find exciting, it'll make working on those things way easier. 

Sorry if this was all over the place, but good luck with everything! Feel free to PM me if you want to talk or need a friend.

What are those rights? Does everyone agree on what those rights are? And in any particular situation, is it clear if one's rights are being violated? You are pretending as if your belief system is correct even though there's points of contention everywhere.

&gt; You seem to think that I’m depriving people of their free will and expression by claiming they’re brainwashed, which actually makes zero sense if you read that sentence very carefully

I admit ""free will"" is hyperbolic in its purest sense, but expression definitionally applies; the implication you are making is that those who disagree with your belief system are incapable of free thought and thus their thoughts aren't worthwhile. 

&gt; But this is entirely how you trap people in arguments: you say something that makes no sense so people waste time discussing that.

Nah, here's what I do: I maintain focus by pointing out one **specific** issue with your argument at a time, usually the most ridiculous part (in this case, the fact that people who disagree with you are brainwashed). You then think I'm attacking your **whole** argument, and then furiously defend the one ridiculous statement even when it's indefensible. That's the so-called ""trap"".

&gt; because I know you don’t support tyranny, and I know that because of your religious views, you’re comfortable with the idea of a universal source of morality and ethical reasoning

Exactly what I'm talking about. You assume I'm attacking your whole argument when I'm not. I've never once said I morally support the CCP.

&gt; I don’t think you comprehend the idea of an entire nation of people being raised by their parents, educated by state-sponsored schools, and lack of exposure to any other reality, all to think that their government and their way of doing things is the best.

Reports of organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners and other political prisoners in China have raised increasing concern by some groups within the international community. According to the reports, political prisoners, mainly Falun Gong practitioners, are being executed ""on demand"" in order to provide organs to recipients. The organ harvesting is said to be taking place both as a result of the Chinese Communist Party's persecution of Falun Gong and because of the financial incentives available to the institutions and individuals involved in the trade.

Reports on systematic organ harvesting from Falun Gong prisoners first emerged in 2006, though the practice is thought by some to have started six years earlier.

However, the way I view it at this point is that there is going to be no way for a peaceful resolution unless either the HK protestors stand down or the Chinese government stands down or they reach a compromise. China’s not going to stand down or budge since the protests are such a threat to their and Xi Jinping’s images, esp the protesting during the 70 year anniversary that arguably got more attention than Xi’s actual words. To give into the protestors or reach a compromise would make the government appear unbearably weak. So I think China’s going to try to crush the rebellion as a show of force. The HK protestors don’t want to stand down as that would invalidate the entire protest, and if they stand down now, they would likely be subject to worse policies in the future. So yeah, it’s one thing to recognize that the protests are getting more violent on both sides, but it’s not like the middle ground is morally better here. The protests are just going to get worse. Today, a taxi rammed into a crowd of protestors and injured several people before the mob pulled the driver out and beat him bloody. I predict without significant outside help, the protests are going to be violently crushed by the Chinese government, so is it better to stand by and do nothing or support the Chinese government or support the protestors?

If you are calling anyone, who maybe just got scared by all the violent, a oppressor of Hong Kong people, what difference does it make between you, and the guy that tears down the stickers? Everyone should have the right to have their opinion heard, regardless of what side they are on.

&gt;I just flew out from Hong Kong this August and I live 20 miles across the river from Hong Kong, my flight was almost canceled because of the protest (and I do have friends whose flights actually got cancelled). I had to travel to Hong Kong every week to see my girlfriend working in central in July and I have never been so scared of my life for walking on the streets. Hell, I've walked the street of Baltimore at 10pm and I wasn't that scared. People are getting attacked simply because they don't support the protest (not even that they support the oppression), tourist from mainland are getting attacked simply because they don't speak Cantonese. I'm not saying you should suddenly turn against the protest, but maybe, just maybe, try to looking things more peacefully and subjectively and stopped attacking people on the forum for may be just a little concerned about the protest.

I have a feeling that you genuinely side against the protest however you are trying to take a more neutral angle such that you are more convincing. Anyway: 

You are upset because your flight got cancelled while people are being *murdered* for fighting for the freedoms they thought they had?

If nobody was inconvenienced the world would not care. The protest *was* peaceful, and unbelievably so for how many people were participating. Now people are disappearing, getting shot with lethal firearms from point-blank range, and getting brutalized by the very structures that are supposed to be protecting them.

From my point of view, I believe the Chinese government to be incredibly evil and oppressive. The lack of democratic processes, the surveillance state, the lack of enumerated freedoms, the lack of fair access to justice and presumption of innocence, etc is strong evidence of a corrupt and diabolical regime. There is ample evidence of concentration camps where the Uyghurs are being killed and their organs harvested, and that is by no means the limit of their gross human rights violations. The Chinese government has long been engaged in a disinformation campaign used to indoctrinate and discredit opponents to the totalitarian state.

While I agree with you that peace is the most desired solution to conflict, it is not always possible. If protestors are targeting individuals who simply disagree with their movement, that is an atrocity and should not be tolerated. But, I would be extremely careful of who is making and disseminating those allegations.

definitely apply ed if you rly want to go to cornell, and note that you would qualify for the tata scholarship for indians if you need significantly high aid.

9978,"Not in or from Hong Kong, but I hope I can shed some light on this issue since I've been following it for a while now. 

Keep in mind that the protests started off, and still are, for the most part, very grassroots and not led by any singular figurehead, which greatly decreases any effectiveness for reaching a desired goal, imo. But the general five demands I believe you're referring to are: withdrawing the bill, Lam stepping down, releasing those arrested, investigating police brutality, and general greater freedom. 

The root issue, withdrawing the bill, was only addressed last month, after the protests had already been going for many months. Essentially a very delayed response by the HK government, likely caused by the fact that the Chinese government has de facto control over the HK govt, and giving in to the protesters' demands would be somewhat of a losing face scenario for the communist party. Ceding anything to protestors would be bad for their public image as the supreme power. I believe Lam / the communist party underestimated the dissatisfaction and complete lack of confidence that the people of Hong Kong had with their government, and so decided to wait for the movement to blow over. But after the protests and the lack of government response or communication, as well as incidents with police and protesters, the protesters widened their scope of protests. 

In general, the other four demands by the protest movement have not been addressed by the Hong Kong government. This is probably because Lam is pro-Beijing and basically serves at the whim of the communist party. As for releasing those arrested and investigating police brutality, it seems at this moment that the government is backing their police force wholly, which causes a loss in public trust, which just makes the protests worse because the people feel like they're not being heard. 

Now the protests have escalated, and it seems inevitable that something drastic will happen, due to the government's inadequate responses and lack of communication, which is pretty unfortunate. The move by the government to ban masks in public comes at a very bad time, when protesters are already incensed and angry. It's likely many people see this as a move to stifle and suppress protests. Also, with many incidents involving police and considering China's advanced facial recognition technology, they probably feel like masks are a big part of how to protect themselves. I'd say it's more about the timing and the context in which the whole situation is happening, rather than the actual law itself.

Something I want to say is that Hong Kong will lose their autonomy and freedoms in whole to China in 2047, as per the current agreement. Many people -- especially the youth -- see many signs pointing to the encroachment of China on rights in Hong Kong now, and they're terrified because it's happening too soon.",0.0214,0.2829,0.6957

My best advice: check out the courses of both CS and ECE in the handbook. If ur unsure of the courses u can look up past rosters for the professor's name and email them. Also, talk to ur advisor before selecting courses for next sem. bc it u want to double major, u would most likely have to be very careful to choose ur courses so u don't waste time taking a course that does not contribute to either Major's requirement.",0.1568,0.661,0.1823

She didn't say I shouldn't  be with her and I shouldn't  be gay, just ""what did I  do wrong to make you like this?"" She was very confused and didn't know what to do or how to feel. (Granted, I'm from an Asian and traditional household.)

""‘Hate speech’ consists of verbal or non-verbal communication that involves hostility directed towards particular social groups, most often on the grounds of race and ethnicity (racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, etc), gender (sexism, misogyny), sexual orientation (homophobia, transphobia), age (ageism), disability (ableism), etc."" -- [Oxford Law](https://oxcon.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law-mpeccol/law-mpeccol-e130)

1. Just don’t take notes. What’s the point? If your baseline is learning nothing in lecture, and taking notes does nothing, then those notes are pointless. They’re a sunk cost anyway so just don’t take them and tell yourself you’re going to watch the lecture like a movie. 

2. Tell yourself you only have to absorb 40% of the information. Again, that other 60% is a sunk cost because you weren’t going to absorb it anyway, and 40% is better than nothing. Not putting too high pressure on yourself will keep your mind from worrying about whether or not you’re learning enough. You can review any posted slides, maybe your friends notes (if you have friends, I kinda don’t, so this motivates me to talk to people in class)

3. Figure out the topic beforehand and try to learn about it for like 10 minutes before lecture so that you frel familiar with it. Like just read some Wikipedia on it or something and you’ll absorb so much more if it feels like you’re not being exposed to it for the first time in lecture. And let’s be honest with ourselves: we weren’t going to thoroughly do the readings beforehand anyway. 

4. Find a place to sit in lecture and sit in it all the time. I think it makes it kind of fun to feel like you have your “own” seat, and you also might notice regulars sitting around you. Don’t worry about this if you’re always late to lecture.

Yeah, I'll play devil's advocate for this one.

Supporting the Hong Kong protests, by definition, is supporting protesting against the Chinese Authoritarian regime.  As a result, doing so invariably influences Hong Kong citizens to revolt against mainland China.  This revolt directly leads to physical altercations, altercations which have caused harm to thousands of citizens of Hong Kong.  As a result, regardless of the Hongkongers desire for freedom and self-representation, these protests have resulted in massive amounts of infighting between citizens and local police.

So, because this infighting is inherently bad and not ideal for a well-constructed nation, the Hong Kong protests are inherently hateful, and support for Hong Kong protestors is inherently Hate Speech^^TM.

On the other hand, I sense you are feeling like you might regret it if you don't apply to Cornell. I'm sure thinking about this decision and making it in the next 24 hours isn't helping your stress levels either.   
   
I thought about your situation a bit, and this is what I think. First, I have no idea what you're applying ED to. If it's something like AEM or Econ, which are considered easy majors, you might be way less stressed in Cornell than in high school. Plus, getting an ED acceptance will make the rest of senior year way less stressful for you and you'll be able to focus on improving your mental and physical health before college without worrying about grades. So it could work out great for you.   
What is harder is if you're in a rigorous technical field like engineering. In this case, courses aren't gonna get any easier, and you're not gonna get any less stressed. But the same is True at any college worth its salt for a technical degree, and you'll be stressed anywhere else - at the end of the day you are the one who has to go against your instincts and prioritize your mental health at the expense of your grades (which btw, once you're in a good college your GPA is worth almost nothing compared to a ton of other factors, especially in STEM). So I don't think Cornell would necessarily be worse than other schools in this regard by enough to consider going against the dream and possibly carrying that regret, because you're going to face the same problems anywhere. If you think Cornell is a particularly stressful place compared to other similar STEM programs or buy into the suicide myths, trust me, it's bullshit.

Frequently students make commitments at the beginning of the semester when academics can be neglected and get overwhelmed during prelim season.

Overall, prioritizing health isn't something that most Cornell students do, but it's not impossible to prioritize your health and well-being if you're willing to act on your priorities rather than being dragged into overcommitting both academically and with extracurriculars.

I'm sure they would love if the workers hired by the contractor unionized, but that isn't what they are protesting.

Here's an excerpt:

&gt;""You may well ask: 'Why direct action? Why sit ins, marches and so forth? Isn't negotiation a better path?' You are quite right in calling for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word 'tension.' I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, so must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood. The purpose of our direct action program is to create a situation so crisis packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation. I therefore concur with you in your call for negotiation. Too long has our beloved Southland been bogged down in a tragic effort to live in monologue rather than dialogue.""

I'm very passionate about civil rights so I don't make this comparison lightly. But I think this passage (and the whole letter) highlights the importance of standing up for your rights. Even if it means shouting and honking on campus. *Especially* if it means shouting and honking on campus. This may sound terrible (not trying to minimize the importance of your prelim grade), but workers' rights are important. If they're working on construction on campus and their employers aren't treating them well, or paying them well, or letting them join/form unions, then why shouldn't they raise hell? Too often in this country the worker gets swept under the rug in favor of the comfort and peace of mind of other civilians.

And yeah, it's uncomfortable. That's the point. The whole point is that the marginalization of construction workers cannot exist on campus while everyone else goes on their merry way. Eventually something has to give. The protestors just hope their employer (contracted by Cornell) blinks first.

10486,"Wasn’t there a Black Mirror episode on exactly this? Sure, maybe a social credit system could do good, but I think the chance of it going badly is much greater for a couple reasons.

First, as it’s done by the CCP, it’ll most likely be used to push their party line and used to punish dissidents. As social credit will be used for things such as getting loans, buying property, traveling outside the country, and school admissions, it can be used as leverage for people who don’t follow everything the CCP decrees.

Second, every system of laws and rules has some bias in it or is unjust in some way. Especially with the social behavior system, the CCP determines the acceptable social behavior which will probably differ in some parts with individuals’ impression of acceptable behavior. For example, “excessive internet gaming” reduces one’s score as well as other things that only affect the individual, not the whole society like the mission says. Additionally, religious practices such as being a believer of Falun Gong or practicing Islam as a Uighur have also docked people points, which is concerning to say the least considering what’s already happening with the oppression of religious minority groups. It’s paternalism to the next level.

Third, there are immense privacy concerns with this system. I realize that they already exist (e.g. targeted ads online, big data collection), but this is mass surveillance on an unprecedented scale. They’ve already been tracking the Uighur population with scary detail. If you’ve seen the Xinjiang police app, they track how much electricity and water a person uses, logging abnormal levels for suspicious activity. They check the last time you bought gas, and the National ID number of the person who bought it. These pieces of information seem innocuous separately, but together, it’ll essentially result in the CCP being scarily invasive in someone’s life.

I’m Chinese, but recently became an American citizen, and I’m scared for my extended family as they all still live in China. I think there’s a vast difference between disliking the CCP and still loving China.",0.0266,0.3093,0.6641

I can assure you that imposter syndrome is a very real thing, though not always in the capacity that it is used colloquially. I don’t think it is, by itself, a disorder, rather than a culmination of many internal and external factors (eg childhood, low self esteem, underlying psych issues, etc.) 

Much like “anxiety” and “depression” are used in very general, non-clinical ways, I think “imposter syndrome” has been co-opted as a blanket term to describe people who feel inferior in some capacity to their peers. This, as you stated, may simply be the case. However, there is a difference between somebody who is stressed about being below the median on a test versus somebody who suffers from an anxiety disorder so severe that they’re up for 48 hours before a job interview they eventually withdraw from because they feel like the recruiter won’t appreciate what they have to offer anyway, just like there is a difference between somebody who is sad about a breakup for a month versus somebody who is contemplating suicide.

So when you say to someone ""imposter syndrome isn't real, you just don't deserve to be here"" you are actually undermining your stated goal of being honest to the students who won't make it. Not to mention the real world isn't meritocratic in the least, and being ""talented"" goes out the window when you start applying for jobs. Cornell students have such a huge leg up by default that they WILL succeed, relative to other settings they could be in, and then justify their admission in that way. Are there people who didn't deserve to be admitted? Sure. Will they all justify their admission in retrospect? Yes. So it doesn't make sense to talk about imposters, because once you are at Cornell your outcomes can only be judged relative to yourself, not others.",0.0389,0.2625,0.6987

I will say though, humec may have a higher acceptance rate but they care a lot about fit, so make sure you have a good reason for applying.

To address some of the other replies in your post, premed is no cakewalk anywhere but it is definitely known to be tough here. Impossible? No. I know quite a few people who are doing well grade-wise but you do have to bust ass to get those grades. I also know quite a few people who have dropped premed because it was too much or because their interests changed.

Gets people to reevaluate their choices and make small changes. At the bare minimum, activism like this gets more people involved even if its through some insincere instagram post.  Even in environments like this, protest teaches people how to protest and gets those who can and are willing to do so in contact with one another, skills and connections that are incredibly useful when there is an appropriate reason to protest later on.

10895,"I'm gonna level with you here: If you define any guy who goes to parties sometimes as automatically not wholesome, you're narrowing your choices, especially here. Cornell is called the party ivy, and it seems that's an accurate moniker. Parties are a decent amount of the social events, and they also aren't (entirely) inherently un-wholesome. I have multiple friends of both genders here who go to parties just to get out and socialize; they don't drink, they don't get involved in any intimate dancing, they just go, hang out with friends if they brought some, and have a good time.

My experience so far has been that people who wouldn't naturally be party people seem to end up going to the parties at some point or another for the social aspect or just to see what's up. I'd categorize myself as such; I never partied before coming here, and I've gone down to Collegetown multiple times just to get out and have some fun.

So perhaps if you're having trouble finding any guys who don't party, it's because there are wholesome people who go to parties too :)

As a more direct answer to your question, though, they're not just going to run into you on the way to and from class. Talk to the people sitting near you in classes, especially if they seem like they'd be the type to fit what you're looking for. Join clubs, perhaps more relaxed ones that would have an environment to talk to people. Introduce yourself to guys who are sitting alone in the dining hall; it may be a bold move, but in my experience a good portion of the people who are sitting alone do so because they don't have anybody to sit with right then, not because they're completely anti-social.

And, seeing as this is Cornell, perhaps a little larger portion of the wholesome people here will also be a bit socially awkward or weird. It doesn't mean they wouldn't like to socialize, just that they might not be amazingly comfortable with it yet. If you're still struggling to find normal guys, maybe give some quieter ones a chance and see if they open up once they get comfortable around you.",0.3615,0.5343,0.1042

10939,"I live at Schuyler and I’ll try to play devil’s advocate here. One thing I’ll concede is that food theft is a serious issue and one that doesn’t seem to be going away. However, consider the following:

If your room is on the other side of the building, you won’t hear the construction. Alternatively, you could always get some ear plugs because you live on a college campus and there’s bound to be noise everywhere. 

Yes, going uphill is quite a walk, but 20 minutes to Collegetown is a gross exaggeration. It’s more like 5-10 minutes to get to Dryden Rd/Cascadilla unless you’re really out of shape.

Part of living farther away is learning how to manage your time. You might not like to hear it, but learning bus routes, cooking your own food, walking a few minutes extra, and generally being responsible for yourself are the things you’ll likely be dealing with if you decide to move off campus (and after you graduate).

I’m not saying this to try to get you to live here—West is better in a lot of ways. North is okay too if you don’t mind living near freshmen and construction noise with the new dorms being built. However, you shouldn’t let a horror story be the only thing that decides where you’re willing to go. I’m much happier here in a single than I was last year in a forced triple on North.

There’s plenty of time to look around and start coming up with a list of what options you have.

11011,"&gt; I'm shocked they said they would support divesting from STEM.

I don't think that this was said as part of the official platform; there were several questions about this during meetings and union officials generally were awkward/evasive about it, which makes me think that it is treated as a possible outcome internally but understood to be bad optics (and I'm sure that everyone there would *prefer* to just give more money to everyone, if this were in fact achievable).

&gt; It's about bringing the base level up for everyone, not redistributing limited resources

Well, but resources *are* limited. Where would the additional resources to bring the base level up for everyone come from? It's not like most of us have significant leverage over the professors (to make them give up some of their own benefits for our sake - e.g. fund more travel from grants?), who aren't exactly paid well relative to what they could earn in industry (or by moving to a non-teaching research lab) either, or the grant-giving agencies, which would not respond to non-scientific reasons to increase a grant and probably react to a request to further increase our overhead by reducing the number of grants to our institution. The only source of funds that could give would be the administrative component of the university, and the rest of the union's program to me reads as them wanting to grow rather than trim it (see below).

&gt; Calling for diversity and inclusion as well as holding admins/professorss accountable (it's not about disempowering professors, only those who abuse their power - we know some of them are out there) is of course an important function of a union too. But it doesn't sound like they made a compelling argument.

I've never heard anything from them about holding administrators accountable; it's all about holding professors accountable in a way that implies more and more powerful administrators. (Likewise, ""diversity and inclusion"" usually winds up being implemented by means of installing largely unaccountable administrators who are more than happy to serve themselves and their political group at the expense of the institution's health and academic mission: cf. the [recent Oberlin bakery case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibson%27s_Bakery_vs._Oberlin_College))

Administrators already get better benefits and work conditions than either us or the professors, exercise an unearned and unreasonable amount of power and influence over our lives and extract a tax from ""the fruits of our labour"" (grants) in the form of overhead that amounts to something like 60% if I remember right. If CGSU gave any indication at all that they are willing to make a stand against them, rather than using them as convenient allies against a group (professors) that I share significantly more interests with, that alone would probably have been sufficient for me to switch to supporting them.

&gt; it's not about disempowering professors, only those who abuse their power - we know some of them are out there

I'm skeptical that such a thing as a punitive process that would not affect the innocent negatively at all can exist. Surely the threat of initiating an arduous and invasive fact-finding process (which probably will not even have the customary protections of the public law system, if existing instances of universities adjudicating anything are anything to go by) will give students in a bad relationship with their advisor additional leverage even in cases where it is squarely the student's fault. As it stands, professors loathe even initiating academic-integrity proceedings against undergrads when there is blatant cheating because of how much of a time sink the procedure is; surely the procedure if a professor is accused of mistreating their student(s) would be worse.",0.0775,0.4525,0.47

11014,"Ugh. That sounds like a very bad representation of what unionization is. I'm shocked they said they would support divesting from STEM. The primary message should be that workers are stronger together and unionization improves the quality of life across the board - because it does. It's about bringing the base level up for everyone, not redistributing limited resources, pitting disciplines against each other, or ""leveling the playing field.""

Calling for diversity and inclusion as well as holding admins/professorss accountable (it's not about disempowering professors, only those who abuse their power - we know some of them are out there) is of course an important function of a union too. But it doesn't sound like they made a compelling argument.",0.0748,0.382,0.5432
11015,"I like the idea of unionization in principle, but the people running our particular incarnation seemed to be dedicated activists for a political cause that has little in common with my best interests as a STEM grad student. What stood out to me at the handful of union meetings I went to:

* talk about how bad the PhD students in various humanities disciplines have it, all but saying that they'd happily take the university transferring more resources *away* from STEM to them as a compromise

* someone holding a long speech in an affected quavering voice about how their advisor traumatised them and they got PTSD and this is why we need to empower the administrators to adjudicate and punish academics

* demands for more Diversity and Inclusion

* calls for solidarity with {teachers, workers, one or another faction inside the Democratic Party}

I did not hear a single argument as to how forming a union would benefit me personally; it seems that I would have to pay them dues which would largely be redirected into doing US politics, their ambitious target for ""increasing"" grad student salaries (which did not come with any particular outline of how this would be achieved) was actually below what I am being paid, and their ideas for a contract were unlikely to benefit me now and certainly would be a plain detriment to future-me if I were to go on to stay in academia as a professor.

I mean, yeah, I'd be for it if that were actually what's being demanded. I thought I said in my first post that I theoretically like the idea of unionization. 

&gt; It is strange that you claim you never heard that unionization is about holding administrators accountable.

When you say things like that, I'm never quite sure if you are talking about the unionization campaigners at Cornell or about the unionization movement in general. My qualms were specifically with the Cornell incarnation.

&gt; Most professors stand by unionization so I am pretty shocked that you think otherwise. 

I didn't say that I think otherwise. I don't know where our professors stand; most of them kept remarkably quiet on the matter.

&gt; Especially if it comes at no cost to you? 

Well, that part specifically is unclear because the university administration (who will have the ultimate choice as to how anything is paid for) may just choose to plug the gap by increasing grant overheads rather than taking it out of their own salaries...

&gt; As for your skepticism regarding adjudicating abuse cases, I am pretty speechless. Do you really think ""the innocent"" are not negatively affected in the present system?

Of course some of them are. The question is if the system that they would install would have an undeserved negative effect on more people.

&gt; If anything the failures of Title IX prove that victims need an advocate untied to the interests of the university.

What are the failures of Title IX, in your eyes? In my eyes, the main failure seems to be the lack of any due process that is in line with what would be expected in any other legal system and the pronounced bias in favor of the first party to file an accusation. Approximately every progressive campaigner also tells me that this is good and just. If I became victim of a Title IX process, what I would want would be an advocate untied to the interests of the US Democratic Party, not of the university.

&gt; If it takes a ""time sink"" to bring chronic abusers to justice, so be it.

In my time here, I have encountered 1 chronic (labor, not sexual) abuser professor who is starred on approximately every diversity and outreach organisation the university has, and 1 chronic Title IX abuser student. This is admittedly a rather uninformatively sized sample, but somehow, I doubt that either of those people are among those the union is interested in bringing to justice.",0.0377,0.3365,0.6258

However, if you have the requisite subject knowledge in that area it shouldn't be a problem. The benefit would be if you got an ECE minor taking only certain classes and you specifically wanted an ECE job in an area you hadn't studied, then the ECE major would've forced you to take those classes and you would be able to get that job. Keep in mind, this benefit is in the very specific scenario where you not only got a CS major and didn't want a CS job, but also didn't want a job in the area of ECE you were most inclined to study. I find it an unlikely proposition.

It is strange that you claim you never heard that unionization is about holding administrators accountable. That is almost always how it is framed in traditional union campaigns - this is because administrative bloat has significantly increased in the past three decades, driving up tuition costs for undergraduates, and destroying the quality of life for graduate workers.

11465,"I'm looking at AAP's visual art program, however almost all of the people I found with relations to AAP was in architecture; I'd very appreciate it if someone who knows a friend/are in the AAP visual arts program could answer the following questions:

1. The essay for AAP is not the typical ""why Cornell"", it is ""What is your thing?"", which I am interpreting it as an essay about hobbies. Being a visual arts applicant, am I supposed to exclusively write about art? Am I supposed to write it like why cornell or at least include some why cornell elements? If anyone has written this essay, how did you approach it?
2. How heavy is the portfolio weighted in the program? I know it requires at least 18 pieces but I am not sure I could finish (I think I currently have 14 pieces, but there is no way of me pulling together 4-5 more high quality artworks before the deadline). Since I couldn't finish the portfolio in time, my art teacher is suggesting me to NOT apply ED and instead ED to Brown (another school that I like but probably not as much as Cornell), which would go against my school counselor's advice. Any suggestions on that?
3. How is academics weighted in AAP visual arts application? I have a very strong SAT (1550), AP tests, SAT2s and everything but lackluster gpa (3.5) since I transfered to a very prestigious prep school mid-high school and that has really forced me to work on my procrastinative tendencies. My school counselor is saying that if I dont apply early to Cornell it would be a far reach for me, but no one at my school has ever applied in as an arts applicant yet (pretty sure they are talking about arts and sciences, engineering, etc. - for reference Cornell's average admitted naviance is around 3.68 at my school, with EDs being lower - several 3.6s and 3.5s) I think I have a strong portfolio (I would very appreciate it if someone could look at it, but of course I understand that you guys' time is precious), but would this be weighed heavily against me?
4. Despite me having a very strong interest in visual arts, I am not sure if I am going to pursue it as my final career choice (which is the point that I like about Cornell... any person any study heh heh) I know I am definitely going to utilize the immense opportunities that Cornell has to offer and start taking classes in other colleges, and possibly looking at things like concurrent degrees across colleges. Should I mention that in my application/interview or would it make me seem like that I'm just using art to get into Cornell?
5. From what I have heard, the portfolio interview is very important. I submitted the request a week ago (specifically said as an ED applicant) but no one has replied yet. Should I email admissions directly to follow up? What if I didn't get to finish my portfolio and had to move Cornell to RD, do I need to change the request?

11597,"For the most part, for securing an interview:

* They don't really care you went to Cornell/Ivy League/higher ranked institution
* They don't care if your major was more or less rigorous
* They don't care if you took more or fewer rigorous classes, or had a tougher schedule (more credits per semester)
* Your extracurriculars *do* matter a lot
* Your interviews *do* matter a lot - and if you secure an interview, you can use these as a chance to explain the rigor of your school, major, or courseload.
* Going to a better school can serve as a good ""tiebreaker"" for otherwise similar applicants
* Some schools definitely have a large contingent of Ivy League students, but don't get it twisted; they aren't less strict with applicants from Ivy League institutions and those of similar stature, but rather just prefer candidates from those schools that have high GPA + MCAT

Sources: 

* Me: ChemE graduated few years back, took \~20-24 credits per sem; got 2 top 10 interviews, into 1 top 10 school, currently attending top 20 school and have participated in admissions screenings
* Some Cornell friends performed better in terms of GPA in less rigorous major, with otherwise similar applications, and both had more success with top 10 schools than I did
* Another Cornell friend was also a ChemE recent grad, had a lower GPA (not by much tbh \~3.6), better MCAT, and regularly took 24 credits per sem, and hoped the rigor would make him stand out, but instead is having to take a gap year after an application cycle with few interviews and no acceptances. Unsure of ECs, writing, and interviewing skills though.

In my experience, to go up a full letter grade, one had to be \~1 SD above to the mean. So when I took MATH 1910, the mean was a B- iirc, and getting an A meant being like \~ 1.25-1.3 SD above the mean.",0.0716,0.8413,0.087

To claim it is a racist organization is ludicrous as diversity initiatives are at the very foundational core of an organization set to address food security issues in developing nations. 

I’m sorry the author experienced harassment from an invited speaker, and this is something I’ve heard of occurring somewhat frequently in international agriculture circles where some speakers from differing cultural backgrounds express distasteful viewpoints—especially misogyny—which have proliferated in the ag field for far too long. Regardless of this, the central points made about the Alliance are rather absurd. If someone pays thousands of dollars from a limited budget to host a fellow only to have them ceaselessly complain without taking advantage of mediation resources (as blatantly stated from Dr. Evanega’s email), then the most logical response is to seek to use that funding for a fellow that will actually take valuable and constructive insights to their homeland to serve as innovators and teachers in their own right.",0.0334,0.2864,0.6802

I do not have any disdain for south/east Asians or Asian-Americans. I hate the Chinese government, sure. And I strongly dislike anyone who empathizes or supports it.

The way financial aid works for international students makes the rates that you describe virtually impossible. Yes, there are some students in a situation that you've described, but most international students (from anywhere) are paying full tuition, flights, more clothes once they arrive, and everything else required to live. 

If you can pay 70-95k a year to send your kid to Cornell from China (or anywhere, again) they will almost certainly be groomed with silver spoons in their mouths.

First, there *absolutely are illnesses that require medical treatment.* Taking a step back won't help you if you're having a stroke, and like a stroke, mental health can have acute and immediate symptoms that require immediate treatment and will not go away on their own or without medical supervision. Second, there are lots of people who *absolutely should go to the doctor for the flu*. You are are a healthy 20 something? Cool, good for you. Elderly, children, and those with weakened immune systems can require medical treatment for the same condition you shrug off. Lastly, just like the flu, *it can be extremely hard to tell what is wrong with yourself*. You have your own experience and perspective, which is great and a good first pass, but doctors have years of experience telling the difference between what is normal and what is very not normal and needs immediate attention. Maybe that mole is normal, or maybe it is the first sign of skin cancer. Likewise, maybe what you are experiencing mentally is normal, maybe it is very not normal and needs treatment. 

If you have concerns, see a professional. Worst case you wasted an hour or two, but maybe you could also be making a life changing choice. Mental health is unusual because by it's very nature, the fact that we can't see or feel it in other people for comparisons, many people go their whole lives not realizing they had a problem that is very treatable.

12026,"To answer your question at face-value, the best dorms are the main buildings (not the gothics) in Becker, Cook, Keeton, Rose, and Bethe (ranked subjectively in that order, although Becker is generally accepted to be the best, the rest just kinda tie for 2nd).

Now, to really address your presumed deeper intent on getting decent housing:

Before you go on getting your hopes up about scoring a suite in a main building on West campus with livable bathroom accommodations, remember that the room selection process is very appropriately named the Housing *Lottery*; it's a lottery not because it's entirely random–it isn't, see below–it's a lottery because for the vast majority of freshmen/rising sophomores, you're basically paying someone to validate your stupidity, in the same way lottery tickets have been referred to as a tax on dumb people. For the record, I'm not giving anyone flak–you freshmen aren't dumb, and Cornell housing isn't just being sadistic, but the setup of the situation is just plain unfortunate where Cornell can't move fast enough to provide adequate housing conditions for all enrolled students, but nonetheless needs to encourage people to go for on-campus housing, leading to a bunch of disillusioned, soon-to-be-disappointed freshmen.

For starters, you technically don't have an equal chance of scoring the best rooms on West. First pick is more or less given to upperclassmen applying for continued occupancy, having secured [Active Citizen status](https://carlbeckerhouse.cornell.edu/people/Active-Citizen.cfm). These number to roughly a dozen or so per ""house"", which means about 60 spaces in the main houses are probably already taken before General Room Selection for freshmen even begins.

Right now, I'm technically living on West Campus, but it's a ~~step~~ great leap down from what the main West Campus houses are like. The situation is (very) gradually improving at my dorm, 109 McGraw place, but by no means would I ever sign a contract with Cornell housing again. Since you specifically mentioned the bathroom situation, let's do a quick case study here. The first floor showers don't have dividers, and just consist of the bare showerheads, so there isn't much privacy. On the second floor, leaves and critters frequently come in through the window. There are still urinals installed the girls' floor (3rd floor), and cornell doesn't seem to plan on removing them soon. The soap dispensers dispense this odd kind of reddish substance that smells odd, doesn't wash cleanly off, and is partially solid/chunky. There really isn't a potable water source in the building–the water from the sinks is full of mineral/limestone particles (it's not white water from the air bubbles either).

What's scary about this isn't just the situation itself–it's that *this, not the main houses,* should be the representative face of West campus. People should know that the **vast** majority of students are appalled by what they have to live with for all of sophomore year, but end up the saps year after year.

Sorry to turn this into a rant. I was a lot like you freshman year, thinking I was ahead of the crowd, looking into housing early. What I really should have done, and urge you to do now, is to look towards off-campus housing. It's signing season right now, Ithacan landlords (not counting housing@cornell) aren't all that bad, and the square footage is often better with most renters.",0.0815,0.4408,0.4777

12057,the Alpha Rho Phi chapter,0.0526,0.8751,0.0723
12058,"... and continuing now (pretty drunk so bear with me)

It's fine to pursue both, but I wouldn't affiliate with both Physics and CS. Take 3110 and 4820, and take 3318 and then decide which one to minor in. There's *ZERO* overlap between the two subjects and its simply not worth doing both. I could triple major in Math, CS, Physics with just two more Math classes. 

My CS career process has been a fucking clusterfuck and a half. Not only do you miss out on valuable networking opportunities (which is all that matters to get a job, even in CS) due to your batshit insane workload, but you have to deal with a 22-credit schedule while interviewing (which is a 6-8 credit course if you're leetcoding it up like you need to). I had a near mental breakdown last semester because I was struggling to get interviews anywhere, and the places I was getting interviews with were rejecting me after technical interviews I aced (trust me, one of them asked 3sum, and I gave the 2 pointer method, and they still inexplicably rejected me). I applied to 500 companies last semester for an *internship* and I didn't get a single one. Even after dedicating a good amount of time towards interview prep that could have gone towards prelim prep for quantum and 3318. 

Even this semester I've applied to 200+ jobs. Full-time positions are definitely more... networking-ignorant, but it's still a lot of wasted time. Had I just utilized networking last semester to get an internship at Google, FB, or MS, I could be sitting here, stress-free because I'd have a return offer. But no, I'm drunk-studying for my Quantum 2 and 4810 prelims next week because I can't afford for my gpa to drop, because my only option may end up being a master's program at MSU. Don't get me wrong, I've gotten interviews at Google, Amazon, and Apple this semester (which I never got when applying for internships) but it took a shitload of work and lots of favors. 

CS is not a meritocracy; neither is academia, as I've learned tonight. But it's 100% marketed as one, and its a fucking lie and a half. These companies that sell themselves as organizations full of the smartest people on the planet, are nothing more than frats that accepted the people that were best connected and could just barely scrape their way through their interview process (or got an internship through a half-baked referral and didn't delete the company's entire backend to manage a return offer). The CS recruitment process is *extremely* broken, and I'd be surprised if we don't see **major** reforms within the next 5 years after this upcoming recession. 

I'm sort of going on a consipiratory tangent, so I'm going to loop back to this. There's very, very little utility in pursuing both majors. Most PhD programs will not give a shit about your CS major, most tech companies will give zero shits about your Physics major. Out of **THIRTY** interviews I've had in the last two years, only two companies have even **mentioned** my Physics major. These HR cuckolds don't have the fucking brain capacity to comprehend the fact that the Physics major is roughly 3 times as difficult and time-consuming as the CS major, and the insanity it takes to major ini both. The only two companies to even reference the fact I'm pursuing both are Nvidia and Apple. Nvidia offered me an internship before rescinding it due to Softbank pulling their investment in March of 2019, and I was nowhere near qualified for the Apple role. 

I'm good at what I do; studying for both Physics and CS courses. But I'm even better as a programmer. It's a damn shame no one will ever realize that though. 

If you're a masochist like me, a Physics and CS double major may be possible. But be 100% prepared for the fact that you may have to delete FB and Snapchat because you can't handle the fact that everyone you know is at some homecoming concert or halloween party at sig pi while you're at the library on a Friday night and have no idea when you'll be able to leave. Be 100% prepared for *your friends to get pissed at you when you say you don't have time to hang out and they don't believe you, thinking that you're ghosting them*. And be 100% prepared to essentially becoming permanently brain-damaged from sleep deprivation and depression. I have a twitch in my left eye that hasn't gone away even after getting healthy akonuts of sleep all summer and going through caffeine withdrawals. All of my few college friends have mentioned how my personality has changed dramatically after certain stressful semesters. 

If you do a CS &amp; Physics major, the supposedly best 4 years of your life will become the worst 4. If you think you have the work ethic **and** the intellect to handle the hardest double major this school has to offer (because you'll need both), go right ahead.

One reason is that CS majors have to take three external electives from a non-CS department, which naturally becomes a potential second major. It's also necessary to at least take several CS courses or get a minor in CS to be somewhat competitive in the graduate school application pool(talking about STEM programs only), and many just make it to be a CS major along their ways.

-  Fall Algo with Tardos is generally easier than the Spring version. 

- Consider the prereqs of the elective classes you want to take to decide the order.  

- You can take multiple core classes in one semester. The only pairing that's impossible is (3410, 3110)

2. What have you done in high school to prove you'd be a good fit?
3. What aspects about ILR excite you? Examples you could write about include  ilr's credit internship program, the flexible and multidisciplinary nature of the major, the program's tight knit community and professional network, the access to social science research, the social justice ILR engages in (ex. the ILR prison job fair for helping the incarcerated get back into the workforce),  and ILR's commitment to improving world of work. Lol I basically just gave you your reasons, you're welcome lmao

As for some essay advice,  you could start off your application by detailing an extra curricular or experience you had and how it inspired you to be lawyer/hr manager/sports business person or whatever career path or goal or passion you have. If you volunteered in a low income area for example, you can discuss about the social inequality you witnessed and how it inspired you to become a  labor attorney or something of that sort.

Then from this, I would discuss how ILR would help you achieve your goals versus any other major at Cornell or any other university. After talking about why ILR, then you should talk about how you envision yourself at ILR and what you'd do as a student if you got in.

I think this should be a pretty straight forward essay. I can already think of what to write about and I'm not doing anything closely related to ILR. Though if you're having a really hard time, I would strongly reconsider applying to this major. If you can't defend why you'd be a good fit, it's going to be sort of hard to get in, especially since ILR will want to see evidence/proof of what you've done in high school.

It is more accurate to think of comp ling as a linguistics class rather than a CS class - it is very linguistics focused, whereas NLP is really just machine learning pretending to be something different. The LING 1101 background is therefore extremely important, and tbh you would want even more - ideally LING 3303 (syntax and semantics), and LING 3302 (phonetics and phonology) as well - you can get by with just LING 1101 though.

Regarding projects - when I took the course, there were no projects (except for the final project) - we only had psets. However, the course content as well as the way it is taught varies wildly between instructors, and in recent years afaik a different instructor has taught it every year.

Take that &amp; compare it to HK. What would you have the protesters do?  Allow the HK police to abuse their powers?  It’s like an abusive marriage.   The abuser will continue this cycle of violence until the abused has the courage to stand up. 

Not fighting back is also sign of weakness. You may quote MLK or Gandhi but we all know how the CCP deals with peaceful protests (6.4.89.)

12880,"&gt;Living a healthy lifestyle does not automatically mean you should be skinny (plus we all know BMI is a bad measure)

At the risk of dipping into 'I support body shaming' territory this is an extremely bad mindset to have.

Yes, it is bad to shame people on their appearance - not everyone can be a photoshopped Maxim or Men's health model. That being said being 'accepting' of overweight / obesity is ridiculous and dangerous.

Being overweight or obese is considerably bad for your health even if that 'overweight/obese' is from a ton of muscle (e.g. bodybuilders). The human body buckles and breaks down in a lot of areas when it has to support that much mass. Even those who are ['Metabolically healthy obese'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolically_healthy_obesity) have other complications like high blood pressure, health issues, joint damage, other internal organ complications, etc.  

Men are most healthy when they are relatively lean with minimal &lt;-&gt; slightly moderate fat stores and same with women (although the healthy amount of bf% is higher for them). Light to moderate exercise 3-5x a week is expected for good health as well.

You should not push your personal opinion when it is a matter of health. As much as it can be painful to hear it is not healthy to be overweight or obese. I technically fall into the obese category (this isn't a 'haha im skinny and ur fat' post) because of my hobbies but I understand the risks associated with it and am willing to deal with them - others should be too.",0.0718,0.3588,0.5695

Some problem sets are a lot of work, but it should be better this time around, now that Halpern knows how much time things take. A few problems sets took me 8+ hours and a few took 2. Here's my perspective on the difficulty:

If you are a math major with a few honors math courses already taken: 2802 should be pretty mild (and 2800 a walk in the park).

If you are a physics major with a theoretical side: 2802 is a nice introduction to mathematical rigor that you will need, and it covers important topics

If you are AEP/experimental-leaning physics student: it'll probably be different/more difficult than most math classes you have taken (2940, 2930, 1920, mathphys).

tl;dr if you love proofs, take it! If you don't, take 2800.

For example, is the Chinese style of government and economy the best way to raise living standards?  Most reductions in global extreme poverty over the last 30 years happened in China, so there is a fair case to be made in that regard. 

Likewise, the refusal of America’s democratically elected executive branch to acknowledge much less work wrt climate change begs the question of whether humanity can keep its democracies in the face of massive disruptions of which we have barely seen the beginning of, or if it is ultimately necessary for a government to force unpopular action for the sake of ensuring the survival of the population (water is becoming scarcer globally and crop yields are already being massively disrupted by extreme and unpredictable weather). 

I would welcome such a debate, and it would certainly be far more befitting of this Ivy League institution to engage in these big questions than for a subset of students to be cowardly ripping off stickers of things one disagrees with, which is what I was taught at an early age is the kind of childish temper tantrum response that is unacceptable among grownups.

(Edit: just to make clear, I’m not trying to argue for or against the CCP, at least not in this post, but rather arguing that in this country we aspire to settle complex issues with discussion and debate, not by shouting down the other side until they give up or leave, Twitter and our current president notwithstanding.

And it's generally inevitable that this will come with some negatives, as happens when any country industrializes - it is still a net positive. But the question is not whether the Chinese government is good or bad. It is whether HK has the right to self-determination, or whether China has the right to claim it as a territory, which is what they are threatening to do. In this question I fall on the side of HK and not China. Regarding the HK bill, it was not passed. It has passed a voice vote in the House, may or may not pass the senate, and will likely be vetoed by Trump in my opinion - he is in my view largely responsible for the scale of this crisis by completely ignoring the situation when no one else has a prerogative to act. As far as the UN goes, China is a permanent security council member and so of course they will not be able to intervene effectively - this is why the UN has become an impotent organization as far as resolving disputes between permanent members. This is why countries like the US need to act, and why Trump's and everyone else's failure to do so has led HK to desperation.",0.0644,0.452,0.4836
13212,"Ok I got u. Yes this is the issue. I think HK is part of China, historically and currently in terms of territory. But yes like u said, the HK system after 2047 presumably to be the same as mainland so the key point the whether the Chinese system will benefit HK people in the future. I don’t know the answer. The system may have some changes in the future. But let’s see how the gov and the system were doing in the past 30 years. My answer is they are doing Fine.

I know that Chinese gov is viewed as “ the bad guy” regarding democracy and freedom in western viewpoint. The gov and the system are not perfect, but it did work in the last 30 years, saving ppl from poverty and developing technology. My grandma was always thankful to the gov because she experienced the poverty in her 20s and she thought the gov did a great job and benefited people ( and that’s also why many Chinese people are patriotic and proud of the country) I guess you know how poor china used to be compared to now. On the other side, there indeed were corruption,control of speech, discrimination towards women in workplaces, insufficient protection of copy right and stuff like that. (These things do not only happen in china)

I agree the gov has a long way to go, after all it’s a young gov (just had its 70th birthday) and I really hope it can do better in the future and gain more international reputation for the country :)

Btw do u know HK human rights bill passed by US. I stand with human rights but this is very weird. If China passed a bill about California, what’s ur reaction? I don’t think foreign gov should interfere with others politics. There is the United Nations who should supervise.",0.4092,0.4494,0.1415

13220,"Yeah, I know they increased demands. When China did not immediately withdraw the bill, though, I think from HK's perspective the problem shifted from a short-term issue to a long-term crisis in faith, with the need of a permanent solution. Their point of view must be, China needs only to wait 50 years and we will become their territory, so why are they forcing this issue now and not backing down? Clearly they think they can have their way with us, and we need to make very clear that this is not the case. You cannot do this just by asking China to take back what they did, then the message is you will not suffer any consequences so why not try to impose as many extra conditions as you want if you are China? A more permanent solution is necessary, with maybe room for a good-faith attempt at negotiation, which does not seem to have manifested.  
  

So you protest as long as it takes, and hope that either people on mainland china or abroad will pressure china to withdraw the bill and they will do so. However, this did not happen, maybe for the reasons you described in China, which perhaps is expected, I don't know. But abroad, not only do foreign governments like the US that are presumably the reason why HK isn't a part of China in the first place show total in difference. They do not support HK explicitly and many public figures and companies actively repress pro-HK sentiment. So then of course some people become crazy, because they see that China can do whatever they want to HK and no one will do anything, and things will only get worse in the future because China will eventually fully assimilate HK. Then of course there is violence, because they are desperate. I can't remember the last time that a group that was in danger of losing their rights to their own government had support from no other countries, and the protest was successful - maybe the closest thing I can think of would be MLK in the 1960s, but even he had strong support from many factions of the American gov't. So I think nothing that has happened in HK is surprising, given the situation they are in, and this may be one of the main points that historians will look at when they write about the decreasing influence of America in the world.",0.0339,0.3719,0.5942

Study abroad opportunities that can be done with the economics major: Cornell In washington which is pretty unique and really cool. I have had friends done it before  [https://www.ciw.cornell.edu/](https://www.ciw.cornell.edu/)

Your internship at the Fortune 800 e-trade company is also really impressive and indicative that you'd be interested in economics. If you can connect this with your passion for economics, I can see you pulling off a really compelling essay. Just be really specific with what Cornell Economic offers and that can really differentiate you.

Since you're also interested in entrepreneurship, depending on how you tailor your essays, I'd also consider talking about the entrepreneurship minor(I mean this minor is in johnson but you could tie it to why Cornell briefly) or the college scholar program (where you could double major in 'college scholar' with economics and tailor your curriculum to a specific interest such as developmental economics or something using departments from entrepreneurship, sociology, econ, and government lol. this could help show you did your research since a lot of students don't really know what this is , especially prospective applicants. Make sure you do adequate amount of research though when talking about it. There's a lot of information on the site but it's pretty unique).

More information about college scholar: [https://as.cornell.edu/college-scholar](https://as.cornell.edu/college-scholar)

Lastly, I think a MAJOR part of CAS is the motto of ANY PERSON ANY STUDY.  I'd heavily advise you to talk a little about Ezra Cornell's mission and the multidisciplinary nature of CAS at Cornell and how you'd be able to have the freedom to explore your interests in numerous different subjects, not just economics also but like music and english. you mentioned in your profile you were really good at the piano and you're vp of the english society? Cornell was truly one of the first colleges of its time to offer a wide offering different areas of study to ANY background (male, female, white, black, hispanic, native american asian, etc.)

Was tired af so my bad if i made any grammar/spelling mistakes. hope this helps.

Oh last remark, you said you were considering ILR or Econ. Have you considered Cornell's PAM major? I think you'd be a good fit for that more so than ILR since ILR is more about labor and stuff.  I guess PAM is also  ""easier"" to get into than econ but it has a lot to do with policy and econ which you have a great background for too. You'd be an amazing fit for this program also especially with your interests. Check the concentrations and stuff.  Note, it'll be hard to internally transfer to Econ tho if you suddenly choose to switch but it's still a pretty good major.

The Sun points  towards it having something to do with the professor walking towards her and raising his voice in response to a question, which is later explained to be a result of his hearing disability (lol). Julia also dramatizes being forced out of the program as if shes being removed from the country. Also, she seems to have been comped a ticket to Switzerland (not explained either) despite being from Puerto Rico...she makes it seem like they're forcing her to leave ""I did not approve the purchase of this ticket in my name"". OK...so pay for your own ticket to wherever you want to go?? Julia paints the Alliance as white supremacist in part by claiming to be the first 'afroindigenous' person invited to the program...although we even had an Ethipoian alliance member from last years program speak out against her in SA. In her recent article, in response to the Professor, she claims she has more of an understanding of hearing impairment than the disabled professor because she has a hearing disabled 3 year old son and uncle, and thus knew his behavior was not a result of his hearing impairment. She ironically then talks about how white people cannot accuse others of being racist...in part because they cannot experience it. I guess Julia has somehow experienced hearing impairment through her son. (Update based on new article she posted) It seems the actual 'racism' was the professor suggesting a specific field of biotechnology would 'save' 3rd world countries despite, as Julia argued, biotechnology resulting in the greatest exploitation of POC in the US. I think Julia believes that white people disagreeing on issues that effect POC are immediately racist, and theres no middle ground. It seems she was constantly disrupting the scientific discussion this program was focused on, by identifying any social justice issue she could associate with a lecture/speaker. The woman is a walking complaint. she also complains that the program constantly misgendered them (they/them are their pronouns--im literally just reading this now and had no idea those were their pronouns)...which unless they had explicitly shared I think is a fair mistake to make in an initial interaction, that someone who uses they/them pronouns cannot reasonably take offense to (esp considering the number of foreigners in the program). They complain about a lack of support for their disability--which is actually ADD. I wonder what 'support' they were looking for considering examinations were not part of the program---therapy or medication?? If you read her articles they have checked the laundry list of embodying every far left idea, as if shes collecting identies or a badge of honor (she also knows how to describe her ethnicity in ways that make her seem special and interesting--almost bragging about just how disenfranchised they make her seem) .

You can’t really help it since insecurities about your capabilities and your progress compared to others are just natural especially when your literally compared to others in grading.

Secondly, professors base their judgement on GREs, GPA, and research interest. If what you want to do doesn't fall in line with what the professor wants to do, then it judt won't work out. Also if 1/3 falters (either GREs or GPA) then if you have something interesting to the professor and the other result is good then they can overlook the one blip.

On top of that, prelim season really adds to it.

It's not all bad though.

My experience, and that of many of my friends, is that if you make an effort to try new things, if you make an effort to talk to people, if you take a positive attitude then it is a phenomenal place to be.  

Things to do to meet people/build a social base/have fun:
1) Join an intramural sport if you are not part of a varsity program
2) Ask someone on your floor if they'd like to go with you to the weekend farmers market
3) Break into Cornell orchards and steal genetically enhanced apples
4) Buy a cheap bike off of craigslist and bike over to the other side of the lake
5) Watch a hockey game (or if tickets are too expensive, there are a lot of other sports at Cornell that would actually love a fan base)
6) Ask a random person on a date.  One of the most fun nights I ever had at Cornell was walking up to the cutest girl I could find at the dining hall and asking her to a formal...she turned me down...but came over to our table 5 minutes later saying she gave away her concert tickets and would go with me.
7) Get to be buddies with the dining hall staff.  Freshman year there was a Chinese couple working one of the grill stations, they'd make egg on rice with oyster sauce for the Chinese students on the sly.  Once they realized I (painfully white) could speak Chinese, all I had to do was smile at them and they'd hook me up.
8) Invite a group from your floor to go and watch stars 
9) Find a local band that plays the college scene in upstate new york and randomly ask people to carpool/join you (lots of cool concerts in the area)
10) Ithaca is Gorges, go hike them

You could approach him after the semester when *everything* is finalized, grades and all; once he is not responsible for you as a teacher, there is no longer a conflict of interest.

I don't think it's too big of a hinderance though, like me personally coming from a single mother with a household income of 25k...it hasn't really prevented me from associating with significantly wealthier friends. W/e I lack in wealth I generally just make up for in effort, and save up money during internships over the summer which allows me to spoil myself throughout the year. I know that there is a negative stigma against CS majors for their bloated salaries and arrogance, but for kids like me it has been the single greatest equalizer in wealth disparity. You can save upwards to 16k in a summer with a CS internship, and that alone is enough to buy yourself a goose (terrible investment btw) or go enjoy spring break in Cancun. Personally though, I give that money to my family / save some for myself / invest. You can also look into CS TAships and Consulting to make an additional sum for lessening the load on cost of living.

Did it happen to cross your mind that college students, regardless of how committed they are to the school, dont like to attend athletic events where the school they're going to doesnt perform well? Could I use ice hockey arena attendance levels as an example of cornell spirit being high then? The fact of the matter is this: Cornell has disgruntled spirits as well as happy ones. There are backbreaking classes that really crush you with coursework as well as classes that feel like a breeze. Cornell is too diverse to say that we have a ""culture"" of ""general"" unhappiness and lack of pride.

Some of the days I've been through, I would consider them the worst of my life. Maybe they're attributed to Cornell, or maybe just to myself. I wish I'd never re-live them; but I appreciate that they indeed happened.

BUT (and this is huge but), I am saying this not to deter you, or to ""manipulate"" hardship. This is rather an ENCOURAGEMENT. It's not about Cornell culture; it's about the culture across all competitive universities. I felt I was broken down so many times; and I was re-built the same amount of times. And this, I can say with certainty, is attributed to Cornell.

It's always weirdly reassuring that, when you are struggling with academics / jobs / life in general; when you realize how you still can't do well enough even though you tried as hard as you could; when you realize your ""ceiling"" is even lower than other people's ""floor"" - you will still, nevertheless, feel reassured that everyone somehow shares your frustration by this ""bigger picture of reality that always dominates""; and you will feel reassured that everyone, despite struggling in their own ways, still strive to be a better version of themselves.

People may get the feeling that such cut-throatness is somewhat exacerbated by Cornell's cold weather, emphasis on tech, etc - but this is rather universal, and nothing specific with Cornell.

2. &amp; 3. im not sure how much academics and portfolio is weighted cuz im not in admissions. for portfolio, i would still try my best and meet the requirement, even if the work won't be as strong. thats honestly fine because out of 18 pieces there are bound to be pieces that arent that great. like in my portfolio, some pieces were weaker but i put them in there to show variety and range in my art-making. as for academics, they matter. like for any student that is applying with an added portfolio or what not, you're still going to be evaluated by the regular admissions panel, so you're still expected to meet whatever standard they have for the rest of the class. it doesnt matter if youre in aap or other college. so, yeah your academics would probably be just as important as ur portfolio,

4. right now, cornell has a new art curriculum that focuses on encouraging art students to branch and pursue academics/studies in other subjects. so its good to mention that you have an interest in different areas of students because thats what theyre looking for. in fact, we have a requirement number of electives that we have to take and we can choose what courses no matter what college. 

5. im not entirely sure what a portfolio interview is...but i dont think i did it...i just had an alumni interview and she didnt look at my portfolio...but i still go in lmao. so i dont think its that important.",0.5104,0.4322,0.0575

14245,"Before dropping, try practicing a bit more. The learning process, especially when learning something physical, is heavily based on creating routine and memory so you can get used to the motions. 

I did not know how to swim when I first started and I was that one kid everyone giggled at when I tried to float. I was the last one to pass the swim test. I would encourage you to go to any office hour offered. They also have open swim hours on Saturdays and some mornings or something like that where anyone is welcome to come practice. Try doing that. Watch youtube videos of instructors talking you through it and try to immitate. You'll finally get it. 

The goal of the course is to have you know how to at least float. That's it for the swim test. Practice just that for a few times a week and you'll get it. 

If you really feel like you can't do it, go to the floor of Helen Newman where the gym is located. Down the hallway and to your right is the PE office. There is a form you fill out and they'll drop you but remember that you'll get a W on your transcript. Also in the future, please keep in mind that some PE courses with fees are nonrefundable and you may be charged to merely drop. I signed up for a PE course with a  $340 fee and was charged an extra $50 for dropping so I basically paid nearly $400 just to add then drop the course. 

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck.

Sounds like you're another person that's mad about greek life but doesn't actually know anything about it.

(allegedly) Phi Psi had this kid over for a dirty rush event (i.e. recruitment event unsanctioned by university, can explain further if needed) where he most likely consumed alcohol and / or drugs. They then probably just let him walk home where he died. 

The #1 thing any house cares about is liability because they don't want to get kicked off (or like actually fucking kill someone). This means taking precautions like not letting people in to opens who are already too fucked up, making sure they have a way home (uber, friends, whatever), *or* if it's a closed event (mixer, rush thing (like this), whatever) being extra careful about what is going on because the people there were personally invited / friends of the house. Obviously some houses actually care and others couldn't give a fuck at all but nobody wants to get kicked off so the end result is the same.

Phi Psi fucked up because 1. they let him walk home knowing he was fucked up not giving him a ride or 2. they couldn't tell he was fucked up. 90% of houses on campus would give a ride to someone they invited that got too fucked up because they either care or just don't want to get in trouble. Inviting a freshman to a dirty rush event, getting them drunk/whatever, and then letting them walk home by themselves is just objectively retarded and it is a shock it even happened.

Joe Halpern is also one of the best professors I’ve ever had at Cornell, he’s such a great lecturer and is so passionate about what he does.

This is something that runs through the middle of our campus. Climbing a mountain or wading into the ocean act as natural acknowledgements of the danger. You know if you climb up something that you might fall down it, or if you go near water that you could drown. But walking across your college campus? That should not, regardless of the natural features nearby, pose a risk.  If this was a gorge that was just a part of the natural landscape removed from campus, I'd say absolutely leave it be, but it isn't. If additional action needs to be taken to ensure that it's safe to traverse near the gorge, I say we have not just good reason, but actually an obligation, to put in place more safety measures.",0.0532,0.4453,0.5014
14452,"Incoming wall of text: The style of the class is kinda different. In 1109 and 1110 you work with the textbook the teacher wrote. Every lesson has 30-40 vocab words that you need to memorize and 4 to 5 short texts that you need to annotate. The texts are more conversational Chinese and not that difficult to understand. In 2209, the weekly lessons are 20th century Chinese essays written in more formal Chinese. I personally don't think the material is that much harder because we spend 3 days on every lesson. In 1109/1110, you need to be able to write pinyin given characters and characters given pinyin (in context). There's also a short essay section, True/False based on your understanding of the texts in the textbook, sentence creation (write a sentence given certain grammatical structures and vocab), and some kind of other grammar section, like fill in the correct de/de/de. In 2209, tests also have a vocab section, but in that section it'll also ask you to give an example of how to use the word. There's a section that checks your understanding of the texts by asking you to use a few vocab words from that text to craft a response to some question about the text. Then there's more stuff on grammar and whatever. It always took me like the full 65 minutes to do the 1109/1110 tests, but in 2209 the first test took everyone \~50 minutes. I feel like the first 2209 test was probably the same level of difficulty as 1109/1110 tests but felt a lot less intense.",0.1107,0.5545,0.3348
14453,"This is most likely not what people want to hear, but it is so sad to me that people's immediate reaction to dangerous natural features is to try to minimize its risk as much as possible. It is an extension of the classic ""Mountains Without Handrails"" debate. I respect the people that want more safety features, but in my mind the better solution is for people to just respect this stuff for how dangerous it is. We don't fence off the ocean because people drown, we don't prohibit people from climbing when mountaineers die in accidents, and we shouldn't (in my opinion) fence off the gorges when stuff like this happens. Sorry if this seems a little cold, but being someone fairly interested in the climbing community, you come to terms with the fact that risk is inherent and shit happens. That said, this is just my opinion, so I am interested in other people's reasoning here. A fair counterpoint would be that this wasn't a risk that he ""opted into"" like the examples I gave, but may have just been lost and slipped down a slope.

edit: also if your goal is to do as little work as possible, try to skip 1109/1110. They're so much work compared to 2209. In 1109/1110 you do 2 quizzes a week (one vocab, one poem), and you need to write \~1000 or more words every week.

Cornell essentially is what you make of it. Social people go to out a lot and go to parties. More introverted people don't (me lol). There are hundreds of clubs to join and tons of interesting events going on at all time.

Engineering in general is hard and its going to be like that just about everywhere. Cornell engineering probably is slightly harder than most due to having a stronger student body.  I came from a super average high school and it was honestly a culture shock seeing how ahead my classmates are. I'm taking multivariable this semester and I would estimate that 1 in 4 of my classmates have already taken multi in high school. There's kids here that have also taken diff eq and linalg and are already pretty familiar with the entire math sequence. A lot of kids have already interned at big companies and worked on all kinds of projects. There is also no shortage of overacheivers here taking 20+ credits a semester.

A lot of people seem to think Cornell engineering is super competitive which in a sense is True. Project teams and proffessional clubs are super selective so a lot of their advertised oppurtunities aren't exactly available to everyone. But on the flip side our coursework environment is super collaborative. I am constantly doing problem sets with others and sharing ideas and problem solving strategies. I have never heard of anyone purposefully screwing someone over for grades. My classmates are all super smart and passionate about what they do.

Will you be stressed? Most likely. Coming here from average high school I feel like I have never worked harder in my life. But unlike high school I feel like all the work I do is extremely meaningful to my learning. My professors here are all super smart and generally good at teaching. While school here is more stressful than average, I think it is a manageable amount of stress and as a result you will learn a lot here.

Kind of long post (thats probably also ridden with errors) but I hope this helps! I EDed here as well and honest don't worry too much about the specifics. Cornell and college life is way different than I expected as a high schooler and I think many people feel that way as well.

the terms/definitions all seem made-up/artificial and the content is literally her ranting about either 1. privacy 2. gender/whatever roles in social media 3. 'fake news' influence

14926,"&gt;The mild sleep deprivation and needing to stay up late means eating more and gaining weight sigh and also not having time to go to the gym as frequently as during the summer How does one prevent this or is it just inevitable?

You probably haven't actually gained fat it is more than likely just water weight from eating shitty foods (i.e. things readily/easily available that you pick because you're busy like junk foods).

Anyway:
______________________________________

'Quick fixes' include:

* Cut out sugary drinks like juices, sodas, etc. It's super easily to drink like 500-1000 calories a day if you just pound cokes or lemonades or whatever.

* If you drink alcohol a lot stop drinking beer/wine and drink liquor (safely - know your limits!)

* Walk to class instead of taking the bus, or take the stairs instead of the elevator, etc. You burn a lot of calories just walking to campus given the landscape.

More involved fixes:

* Do 30 minutes of light to moderate cardio 3-5 times a week. You're telling me you're too busy to spare at most 2.5 hours *a week*?

* Either go out of your way to buy healthier foods or cook/meal prep things that are better for you. Things you buy at restaurants or even somewhere like Mattin's are usually loaded with extra calories you don't need.

* Sleep. Nobody at Cornell needs to be sleep deprived unless they are 1. bad at time management or 2. actually genuinely extremely overextended (23+ credits in engineering + project team + other shit or something).",0.1056,0.3599,0.5345

15201,"**I realized as I was writing this that it was becoming quite a wall of text, so I've bolded some of the main points for a sort of Tl;dr.**

Firstly, I'd like to say I agree with many of the sentiments here, especially that of u/Waxpapers. However, I think that the function of frats as both social and party scene, especially on a campus with as much of a reputation for partying as Cornell, is being only slightly acknowledged and not fully considered.

From a social perspective, **yes, frats can often create a negative culture** where hazing, sexual harassment and assault, and a social divide and exclusion, are all common. **On that I agree that the culture surrounding them needs to be changed**, and it seems Cornell has already made efforts to do so in more recent years, increasing transparency about punishments of frat behavior and pushing back against normalization of hazing. Is it anywhere near perfect? No, and we need to keep pushing hard against the negative elements of frat culture.

**I would caution, however, against extremity in the reaction to these problems**. Cornell has the title of ""party Ivy"", and it's a deserved one. Students, yes especially underage ones who don't have a more convenient or affordable source of alcohol, go to these frat parties, and they do so because it's a good mixture of socialization and partying.

Is that necessarily the most healthy campus culture? Perhaps not, but it's one that Cornell has. I don't believe anybody here is trying to destroy the party scene, and **I certainly don't think anybody's going to be able to discourage the underage students from finding a way to drink and party.**

So the question is, **what do you do?** **I want to step through the suggestions in Cornell Sun article**, and point out both positives and flaws, before proposing a more measured alternative.

***1. An action plan demonstrating tangible ways they will cease dirty rushing, including forms of punishment for chapters that engage in dirty rush events.***

**To me, this makes perfect sense**, and seems to already be somewhat in place by the university. There's room for improvement, and I see no harm in pushing the issue further to prevent this kind of thing from happening.

***2.  A commitment to make their events safer in the following ways:***

1. ***Scanning IDs of every individual in attendance and fully marking over or under 21 years of age.***

**The idea may sound good on paper**. Get rid of the underage students, and you hopefully have a safer environment with more responsible people who are also legally allowed to drink. **But it ignores several problems.** Many underage students have a fake, and any decent one nowadays scans. So what you're going to end up with is a party consisting of still quite a few underage individuals drinking. **It** **doesn't really solve much, and** **it indeed will just encourage younger students to acquire fakes if they don't have them already**, leading to a campus where anybody who ever parties has a fake. This creates easier access to buying alcohol in the first place, not to mention makes the entire idea of scanning IDs little more than a formality that's also a nuisance (as this means that there has to be somebody at the entrance with an ID scanner at every event)

***2. Having Cayuga’s Watchers, who are students trained in both bystander intervention and sober monitoring,  at every event hosted by a fraternity.***

**Again, this sounds good in idea.** Trained students who mingle and blend in to keep an eye on things is a good principle. But what about the human resource strain? **I severely doubt that this organization has the resources to be present in any meaningful fashion at every frat event**, not with so many going on at the same time. This either means that there will have to be massive investments made into increasing its presence, or it will create a mess where frats are stuck between canceling a party due to not having Watchers present because of the immense number of requests for them, or making the choice to pretend that the Watchers are there and carry on. Overall, **this doesn't seem like an unreasonable suggestion** (it doesn't really impact partygoers) **so long as the likely increase in size of the Watchers can be reasonably accomplished.**

***3.  At least one sober monitor at every exit of the chapter house to check that individuals leaving the house are able to arrive home safely, and have sober people offer rides for those who need transportation home.***

**This sounds like a very safe and reasonable suggestion, until you realize how many doors a frat house has.** Even house annexes usually have a minimum of several exits, and actual frat houses have a truly absurd number of exits. The amount of people needed to actually watch every exit would be unrealistic to implement. *However*, I do agree with the idea. **I'd suggest** ***main*** **doors have somebody near them**, and that individuals who are too intoxicated be driven home by a sober individual or called a ride through Uber or Lyft. **Overall, just a scaleback of the scope**, since monitoring every exit to the building is just infeasible in most cases.

***4.  A poster with the definition of affirmative consent at the front of every chapter house that will be read aloud by party attendees upon entering.***

There is a line between promoting something in a reasonable way, and stepping over that line to the extent where people are likely to ignore what you're trying to say because of how you're saying it. **Do I agree that frats should have to actively promote affirmative consent? Absolutely**. A requirement to display signs that promote affirmative consent at or near the entrance? Sounds perfectly reasonable. **Forcing people to read it out loud as they come in through the door, though, is ineffectual at best and alienating at worst**. It places party organizers in the bad spot of forcing everybody who comes to an event to recite something that I believe many people would view as a nuisance. When you shove something in somebody's face as aggressively as making them read it to get in, I think you can't be surprised when they miss the message you're trying to make in favor of concentrating on the manor in which you're delivering it. **I'd suggest changing this to prominently displaying posters that promote affirmative consent, and emphasizing pushing affirmative consent and a healthier culture surrounding it for the frat culture.**

**So, now that I've looked at the suggestions, I'd say that** ***they push for the right idea but overstep in implementation.***

**The last point I'd like to make is a cautionary one of overly limiting parties.** As the OP in this thread said, the suggestions listed in the Sun article, if implemented in full, have the strong potential to largely kill frat parties at Cornell. Part of what I appreciated coming to Cornell was the attitude the university has towards its frat events. The police presence in Collegetown during the beginning of the semester was glaringly obvious, but not intrusive. They sent the message that they were keeping an eye on everyone, and then they stepped back enough to let people have a good time. The police didn't stop people coming back from parties who were blatantly intoxicated. They didn't break up parties when they were driving past them watching a bunch of underage students drink in front yards. *Why? Because* ***they \[the university\] understood that they can't stop the partying entirely; all they can do is try to keep it in a form where they can keep an eye on it and keep people safe***. I think this is the point that these suggestions from the article miss. **In the attempt to reform party life here, you run the risk of pushing it underground**. Are formal frat events no longer a good time? Underage students can't get in anymore? Can't go anywhere to drink on the weekends? **You'd end up with off-campus, unregulated parties held entirely dissociated from Cornell frats, more partying in the dorms** (which runs a higher risk of covering things up, since parties in the dorms getting caught can lead formal hearings and writeup, which would only increase if the issue of drinking and partying in dorms become more present from crackdowns on frat parties). **You'd end up with more dangerous environments than right now, and this time with no real jurisdiction of Cornell or any of its groups to control them. You'd end up, in short, with a worse situation than we already have.**

**In the end, I think we need to push for changes. But we have to be careful in how we do it, and be measured in our response to these problems.**",0.1137,0.538,0.3482

15221,"The power dynamic of fraternities is heavily correlated with rape tendencies in men. Frat members are 300% more likely to commit acts of rape, and 6% of all frat members have admitted to rape. Its also noted that most rapists are serial rapists. 

Here's something also interesting comparing fraternities with other male-dominant organizations: 
&gt; Being associated with a fraternity or an athletics team also had a positive correlation with alcohol-fueled rapes, the study found. Heads of fraternities were less likely to commit alcohol-related assaults than just members. The opposite was True for sports teams -- the leaders of the teams reported more assaults.

Its arguable that its not that frats attract rapists, its that the culture perverts men into becoming rapists: 
&gt;A previous study by Foubert shows that men who joined fraternities were just as likely to have committed sexual violence prior to college as men who didn’t join a fraternity. But the same study showed that fraternity men were three more likely to assault women than their counterparts, suggesting that fraternity culture was the driving factor for the assaults.

Its also arguable that women that engage in frat/sorority activities are inadvertently putting themselves in harm's way:
&gt;Last year’s Association of American Universities survey on campus sexual assault found that 40 percent of female Harvard University seniors who participated in fraternity and sorority events had been sexually assaulted. The university singled out the groups in a report of recommendations on preventing and dealing with campus sexual assault.

That last sentence sounds pretty familiar.

[Non-Mendeley Source:](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/04/12/study-repeat-rapists-committing-vast-majority-sexual-crimes)

For that last point, here's a [Washington Post Article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/01/30/how-sorority-culture-contributes-to-the-campus-rape-problem/) that delves deeper into the flaws of the sorority system rather than the fraternity system (which I personally believe is a bigger source of the problem at some schools). 

There are countless studies that show there are aspects of fraternity culture that lead to higher frequency of rape.

Now that all the facts are out of the way. I honestly believe the thing that we can do to make campus safer is to allow underage drinking. The 21 year old cut-off is completely arbitrary and was originally enforced by M.A.D. because there were too many drunk driving accidents as kids tried to cross state lines to a state with a lower drinking age. 21 was just the highest common age and so the federal limit was set there. If students have a safer option of drinking in a controlled space where the owners are incentivized to keep customers safe rather than try to cover-up when things go wrong, then these numbers have to go down. I spent my entire high school drinking in bars overseas, and the mildest shit that goes down in some frat parties would get people kicked in the face and thrown out by the bouncer. The school has no jurisdiction over the bars in ctown, so this would never happen, but its the only way we can see improvement imo.",0.0299,0.329,0.6412

15245,"&gt;I dont know how to get started.

Find a 'program.' A program is a routine that has you hit certain muscle groups (chest, back, legs, arms, shoulders, etc.) on different days.

A very good program for someone completely new to the gym is [Stronglifts 5x5](https://stronglifts.com/5x5/#gref). This gets you acquainted to understanding the different muscle groups and how they work, how certain exercises work those muscle groups, etc. You will very quickly exhausted the usefulness of the program but it is phenomenal in terms of getting you acquainted with the gym. 

For the actual compound lifts Alan Thrall has -amazing- tutorial videos. Watch these: [bench](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYKScL2sgCs), [barbell row](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQU8wZPbioA), [overhead press](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol7Hko8RhY), [squat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNPOjaGrVE), [deadlift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYREQkVtvEc) -- keep in mind you should probably deadlift at Teagle Down or Appel.

Seriously - watch those videos!

&gt;you're supposed to do when you get there

Do the lifts/cardio your program tells you to do.

Let's say you are doing Stronglifts 5x5 and today is monday: you would walk in, do an active warmup (get the blood flowing), then go to squat rack. Do 5 sets of 5 reps of squat at a weight you know you can work with (this is trial and error when first beginning - MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A SPOTTER!). You would then bench press and after that do barbell row. Etc.

Generally the format is something like: Bench Press SxR (so 5x5), where the first number 'S' is the number of sets and the second number 'R' is repetitions. So you would perform 5 reps of bench at some weight, take a 1-3 minute rest, and then do another set (until done). Then progress to next exercise.

&gt;when you leave?

Eat lots of calories and protein and get ~8hrs of sleep. The rest makes a marginal difference.

I am ready to have an honest discussion. That is what I was trying to do with my original comment. I gave a succinct summary of (some) of the reasons that I believe Greek Life does harm on this campus.

&gt; There's a lot wrong with the Greek system and a lot of changes that need to happen (I think PHC is actually taking steps in the right direction with their proposed policies) 

I agree.

15332,"Hi! Great question!

I highly recommend this article - [The Dark Power of Fraternities](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/03/the-dark-power-of-fraternities/357580/) \- which traces the history of fraternities as they exist in the United States, and outlines why it is that they are an element of higher education that is almost unique to the United States and why it is that they are allowed to exist despite all of the evidence that they contribute negatively to campus culture.

Personally, I see fraternities as being born out of a really ugly history of racism, classism, and sexism, and this lineage is preserved today by creating exclusive clubs at already exclusive schools. Participating in the system only preserves it, and I'm still waiting for some administrator with enough moral courage to phase it out of campus life.

To give a little more perspective on this, there are other schools that do not have fraternities that instead have co-ed houses, where people are shuffled into groups that stick together and provide the social support that frats have without so much of the strongly negative aspects of fraternities.

15335,"&gt; You are severely overestimating the wealth that many people in greek life have.   
&gt;  
&gt; There certainly are some houses where a majority of the brothers are from wealthy backgrounds (sig chi, AD, etc.) but there are like 30 frats and a majority of them have pretty average demographics. 

When I said ""a small portion of that 30% controls the night life and social scene of the University"", that is what I am referring to. The richest of rich frats control the system. No offense, but in all of my years here, the only frats on the radar are those ones: the biggest and the wealthiest.  
In addition, there are plenty of wealthy people here not in Greek Life, but my contention is that the distribution is unequal (based on my personal experience), and until the university makes public detailed information on the demographics of Greek Life, I feel perfectly happy making that statement. 

&gt; I personally agree with many anti-greek sentiments 

I'm glad you agree with me. 

&gt;but the community provides a ton of value in providing responsibility for parties/drinking. If greek life is banned/removed people aren't going to suddenly stop partying -- they're just going to do it entirely off-campus in a totally unregulated environment. 

Everyone is partying. Everyone is drinking. It's college. But this is where we disagree. Frats regulate these parties out of a desire for self-preservation, because they need plausible deniability when, inevitably, incidents do occur. The idea that a fraternity house is a more regulated environment than a bar or a small dorm room party is laughable. If you are so into regulation, why don't fraternities obtain liquor licenses and hire non-student bouncers in order to secure the party environment. My friend group that I go out with is unregulated in the sense of official oversight, yet I don't have any examples of my friends making people who want to be a part of our friend group drink themselves to death.

&gt; You may not be familiar but every large open party, mixer, whatever has to be registered with IFC/OFSIL, and they send a security officer guy by to make sure the house is following all required guidelines (no open source alcohol (punch), have to open alc and pour it for people while entirely visible, sober monitors, water readily available, etc.). 

I've seen these security officers at work, and it is not the catch-all enforcement mechanism that you claim. I have seen jungle juice at frat parties, and I have personally known ""sober"" monitors who were anything but sober during the event (cocaine, weed, etc). Also, oh man, I could never find water readily available at any other party environment, thank goodness for Greek Life. 

&gt; If greek life is banned the party environment will switch to one where there are literally 0 rules and absolutely 0 accountability.

The burden of proof is on you for this one. 

&gt; As it currently stands frats like to follow these rules and their risk management likes to keep things as safe/acceptable as possible because they don't want to get kicked off (you can knock them for their motive but the end result is the same -- safer events with more accountability). 

This is an example of bad faith following of rules. If I told you I don't cheat on my prelims simply because I have no desire to be kicked out of Cornell (but if there were no rules against cheating, catch me looking over my neighbor's shoulder), as opposed to knowing that cheating is wrong, something is wrong. Where is the proof that these parties even are any safer?

As opposed to drinking jungle juice made by Bradley in Peppa Pig Phi in &lt;random ctown annex&gt;.

You are severely overestimating the wealth that many people in greek life have.

I am on a pretty extreme amount of financial aid and I make it work. Financial aid covers housing and meal-plan to a degree which university-affiliated houses (almost all of them) have provide, and in this regard it's cheaper than living on campus. Dues suck but they're not *outrageous* and can be achieved by most with some saving during the summers / breaks / whatever.

Many others are in a similar situation to mine. There certainly are some houses where a majority of the brothers are from wealthy backgrounds (sig chi, AD, etc.) but there are like 30 frats and most of them have pretty average demographics.

The fall semester of 2019 is not without scandal involving GL.

Despite a [very public and ongoing tradition](https://hazing.cornell.edu/violations) of hazing in **direct violation of university policy**, Greek Life skates by relatively untouched. I have friends in GL, and I have heard stories of unreported hazing at every single one of their chapters. The University's official register of violations is only the tip of the proverbial iceberg.

When I reached out to financial aid they advised me not to do it since technically it would just hurt my aid. So make sure you reach out!,0.0319,0.2931,0.675
15396,"No party is perfectly safe, and I've seen ""friend parties"" have issues as well. But frat parties in particular have characteristics that make them more risky than other parties. At most parties, the people there all know each other- either it's a house party where everyone is in a friend group, or it's an organization's party where most people are basically familiar with everyone else. Because frat parties (especially the open ones early in the year before initiation) tend to have a bunch of people just show up, they end up being full of strangers- people who know a couple people there, but who have never met the majority of people at the party. And the people running the party also often don't know many of the attendees- they know other frat members, but not the mass of freshmen who show up. In fact, that's often by design, because these parties are effectively advertising events.

Also, frat parties in particular tend to attract a bunch of people who just want to get drunk. Freshmen who can't get into parties elsewhere or who don't want the hassle of trying to pass off their fake at a bar will go to frat parties because they know they'll be let in, and once they're there they'll get absolutely hammered. So you get a couple hundred people, a big portion of whom don't know anyone and who are just trying to get smashed, crammed together in a house. The [Panhellenic Council's requests](https://cornellsun.com/2019/11/01/guest-room-proposing-a-freeze-on-mixers-in-greek-life/) *are* pretty dramatic, but they make sense from the point of view that they want frat parties to be as safe as ""friend parties"", where people know each other and are all looking out for each other.",0.1194,0.4863,0.3943

For EnvE it’s a very easy transition to make, and I’m sure it’s similar for BioE

The case for you to transfer to CALS is even stronger for BioE since the majority of undergrads (and faculty I’d assume) are in CALS. On the most recent info sheet I could find, it lists 19 undergrad BioE majors in COE while there’s 204 in CALS. You could also probably put something about increased opportunity for research in the life sciences, which is something CALS could definitely give you more of than COE.

The 2011 Wisconsin Act 10, also known as the Wisconsin Budget Repair Bill, was legislation proposed by Republican Governor Scott Walker and passed by the Wisconsin Legislature to address a projected $3.6 billion budget deficit. The legislation primarily affected the following areas: collective bargaining, compensation, retirement, health insurance, and sick leave of public sector employees. In response, unions and other groups organized protests inside and around the state capitol. The bill was passed into law and became effective as of June 29, 2011.

The major you list on your application has no bearing on what you study when you get here. For COE, you’ll take a survey over your pre-frosh summer so COE can gauge your major interests and match you with an advisor, but they don’t have to match your application major, and you’ll be taking the same general courses as everyone else for about the first year (excluding your engineering introduction, which you get to choose, and any additional courses you take if you have AP/IB credit). The intro engineering courses can help you make sure your intended major is for you or explore other areas of engineering to get more breadth.

As for your essays, just write about what you’re passionate about and don’t worry too much about what major you put. I applied as a MechE and am now (probably) an ECE, but I didn’t mention my major anywhere in my essay—just that I’m super passionate about robotics.

4. On MWF, you have an hour break after your first class. I did that last semester and it made it real hard to go to my first class tbh. Realistically, an hour break in the morning is a bit unproductive for a lot of people.

With learning center, do you mean the Math Support Center? (If not, I'd say check out the MSC :p)
If it is, I'm sorry that you didn't get the help you were looking for! Usually students come to the MSC to work on HW problems, but we can definitely do that kind of thing of ""sit down and go through the material""!! (Personally, I've done that kind of thing with students multiple times already!)

I'd say that, each time you go there, nail down a few topics in specific you'd like to ask about (a single tutor probably won't be able to go through everything at once because of their own schedule, so that's why I'm talking about choosing a few topics each time), and please let one of us know!! (and please make it clear that you're not asking for help in the hw, but rather about the subject!)

If for whatever reason the tutor(s) you talk to aren't able to solve this issue (not necessarily through fault of their own), please let me know! My name is Henrique, and I can try to help! My hours are on the MSC website, but I can certainly meet with students outside of them (it depends a bit on my schedule, but I've done this kind of thing before :) ). Also, *hint hint*: the MSC's Tatkon Center hours (Tues,Weds, 7:30p-9:30p) *after 9:30p* is usually very convenient for asking me stuff. Since some students remain there after 9:30p to ask stuff or do work, I just stay there too until Tatkon closes at 11 to help them.

&gt;all freshman live on north campus. most classes are on central campus. the first two months here I walked most places, but then last week i realized taking the bus is faster, so starting last week i started taking the bus.

&gt;my first class is calc. it's about one hour.y my second class is in the same building. It's modern china, a course about modern chinese history. 

ROCKEFELLER HALL

&gt;done with math, going to history now. just finished history, going to eat now. right now it's raining, but the weather report says it'll start snowing at 2. usually when we're done with class we eat on central campus, but since it's gonna snow we decided to go down this slope and go to west campus to eat better food. *points camera to friend* here's my friend, she'll introduce herself. guy: where are you from? girl: singapore. guy: she is singapore government's.... girl: *english*

SLOPE 

&gt;we just walked down that slope. later we have to go back up.

DINING HALL

&gt;we just finished eating, rn I gotta do half an hour's homework. gotta go back to class later.

outside

&gt;it's snowing!! my friend just left, she also went to class. Right now i gotta walk 10 minutes across this bridge, going back to north campus. 

Mews???

&gt;I'm seriously not joking, right now it's 5:15 and it's already dark outside. look how dark it is. how ridiculous. 

(going to eat)

&gt;right now it's -2 degrees outside. honestly im used to it, doesn't feel that cold, but.. it's still really cold.

after the rpcc noodles

&gt;Just finished dinner, spoke with my dad on the phone a bit. the person I was eating with left, so it was just me, so i just called my dad. and then tonight i have an essay due. and then i have some other homework so rn i gotta start doing it.

the end

&gt;this was just a day in my life, hope everybody liked it. if you have any suggestions for improvement or topics you'd like to see leave a comment below. honestly when i started this i wanted to film a vlog, but i just kept putting it off, and i thought, if i keep putting it off i wont have the opportunity to do it. and then it's also good today was the first day it snowed, so it gave me some motivation and something to do. ok, so i'll leave it there.

Instead of your housing money (~$9k a year if you’re on full aid) going directly to on-campus housing they’ll just refund you (direct deposit or checks) half of that money ($4.5k + meal money if you get that as well) each semester for same total as you get for on campus housing. 

It’s your responsibility to find housing off campus and spend that money wisely, they theoretically help you find housing by providing some resources but it’s the same resources you can google in a minute. You can spend more than what they give you if you like spending money from your pocket or you could spend less than what they give you to save some of it (like I did). You could blow it on hookers if you’d like, it’s essentially your money and your responsibility to spend it how you like. 

As for the 12-month lease, sadly that’s too common in Ithaca and you’ll have to pay for whole 12 months using the money you received or try to sublet it during summer, again this is part of your responsibility, Cornell gives you the money and you do what adults do with money.",0.1238,0.5458,0.3304

I would say that I had a smooth experience. I got my refund a few days before classes started. 

I’m also on a 12 month lease. What I would recommend doing is a summer sublet. That way you won’t have to pay for housing over the summer. If you end up subletting, I highly recommend charging a security deposit to your subtenants. That way, you, as the tenant, will not be responsible for damages caused by the subtenant(s). If you’re on Facebook, there’s a bunch of groups dedicated to housing and sublets. There’s also an off campus list serv as well. Those are some good places to start if you want to get the word out.

16287,"Seconding all the advice to see a counselor if at all possible - just having someone you can talk/vent to that can provide some perspective can be really helpful, and they may also be able to help you figure out specific areas where you're struggling and strategies to help yourself through it. You definitely sound like you're ""smart enough"" to be where you are, and panicking during tests =/= being stupid. 

I experienced something a little similar my freshman spring (including crying in front of my Diff Eq TA, my advisor, and my professor on the same day lol), and although your situation might be different, I can tell you what helped me. First of all, here's what you need to tell yourself - it doesn't matter if other people are smarter than you. What they think about you doesn't matter. You're in this to graduate, and you're gonna do it in the way that works for \*you\*, at your own pace. Your brain might be worse or better in different environments, and that's okay. If you can't be smarter or quicker than other people, you can be tougher. If you talk to ""real adults"", or read comments on reddit/the internet in general, there are so many people who are like, ""I failed 6 classes, graduated with a 2.0 GPA, didn't have a job when I graduated, and now I'm 35 and have a great career/family/life!"" 

Second - your brain works so much better on enough sleep. While this certainly isn't a cure-all, it really helped in my case. Set alarms for the same time every night and morning, and tell yourself your top priority is to get 8 hours of sleep every night (for x days/weeks), no excuses even if you have a lot of work. After a week or so of this, I found that I was able to retain information better, think through stressful situations better, as well as being a \*lot\* more emotionally stable (before: would randomly start crying in class most days. after: wow that stopped happening! 10/10 would recommend). Another thing that really helps me with concentration and anxiety is exercise. I know it's a cliche recommendation and it's hard to make time when you're stressed and busy, but it doesn't have to be a lot to really help. Find something you don't hate that gets you moving, even if it's only for like 10 minutes.

Third - (and you might already be doing this, but if not, read on) if the problem is mostly during exams, then prepare yourself as much as you can for that setting. If there are practice tests/past exams, do them. Go to all the office hours you can and ask the TA/prof about everything you didn't get. Don't be afraid to ask stupid questions, they've heard worse.

I usually do my homework there for calc so that if i have any doubts they are solved then and there. 
I also go to the support class they offer, and it really helps boost my confidence. The structure of the class is that you are given a worksheet with past year questions and you can either solve them at your own pace and there is an instructor who also solves them and you can go with his pace. There are undergraduate TAs who will come to you if you need help for any question. I usually solve the questions at my own pace and check whether i got everything right and then leave about half an hour early (the prof does go kind of slow). 
the professors are also rly fun! my professor studied at university of st andrews and my roommate’s professor (who’s also in calc 1) went to university of queensland so you have this global feeling of learning from all over the world (and you realise that math is universal!! it rly helped me because i went to a british school and i am seriously struggling with english because american english is entirely different but i am not so much struggling with math because 2+2 is always 4, regardless of country)

The AEP profs tend not to get very mathematical, so for example I didn't learn about poisson brackets and canonical transformation and how they relate to hamiltonian mechanics. I have little experience with the physics department to tell if their teachers or curriculum is better, but what I will advise is that regardless of what major you're in, take analysis, group theory, and differential geometry before you do grad school.   
  
On the other hand, the reason for this disadvantage is going from AEP -&gt; PHYS grad school. All of my friends who have gone into applied physics or electrical engineering grad programs - which is almost all of them - are doing great. My overall verdict is that AEP prepares you very strongly for engineering and applied physics research, like photonics or biophysics. It also gives you a slightly stronger experimental background in terms of what's required - 2 courses in AEP vs 1 in phys. The cost of all this is a slightly weaker foundation in the math of physics, which is important for understanding but not for research. I also think it's worth noting that if your interests do change, even slightly, you'll have a much easier time adjusting within AEP which gives you access to all of engineering. Overall,  if you're very sure of your path,  I'd recommend physics, but I'm interested in hearing why you're set on HEP-ex as a freshman.",0.5583,0.3773,0.0645

AEP may have a slight advantage if you want to go into industry, since it has the word 'engineering' in it, and some HR cucks never seemed to learn how to read 'physics' off a resume, but its **extremely** slight. 

I would argue that the main advantages of Physics are its flexibility (you don't need to do the internal concentration although you really should if you want to do HEP) and the faculty. The flexibility is a double-edged sword. On average, the physics major can be easier, since you have people doing external concentrations in Math and other shit, but out of the people applying to phd programs and wanting to do HEP, its going to be equally competitive. Also, you get the freedom to double major in Math or something, whereas AEP will bottle you up with super specific courses, most of which you may want to take, but its nice having the option, especially when phd applications will actually read your transcript so it doesn't really matter whether your major requires a course if you end up taking it anyway.

The faculty is the one major advantage that no one really mentions. Most of the AEP professors are widely considered to be shit teachers. Although some may have an impressive research background, its hard to find an AEP major that will defend their major's ability to teach over physics'. There's a handful of gems, but they're buried under a shitload of crap. In physics on the other hand, its hard to find a professor that is universally hated.

Smaller things that still affect the administration are things like pushing all partying off-campus.

Greek life houses a ton of kids that both collegetown and on-campus amenities can't handle -- even with the new North dorms. A large part of the, ""every student lives on-campus sophomore year too"" initiative is that greek houses, if recognized by the university, are technically considered 'on-campus' housing. 

Alum donations probably the biggest thing holding the admin back. [Klarman hall](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2013/05/klarman-hall-project-begins-open-2015) was paid for by a delta chi alum.

Reggie was in Phi Sigma Kappa. Fisk Johnson was a greek too, I think. etc, etc, etc.

A large part of what keeps these alums (and all of the unlisted ones who donate hundreds of thousands to millions - but not big enough amounts to make news) connected to the university is their houses.

What I expected from AEP was that it would be a roughly even mix of practical engineering and theoretical physics courses, but actually, it is a very theoretical major. The main track is much closer to a physics major than an engineering one; you just have much greater ease of access to more practical engineering courses within and outside of AEP. 

Most AEP graduates go on to do some type of research in experimental or theoretical physics. 

My advice would be to pick the COLLEGE you want to be in, not the major. A&amp;S has more liberal arts requirements than CoE, meaning that CoE lets you take more technical courses at the expense of having less time for fun wonky classes.

I wouldn’t say AEP is better for experimental physics, but I would say that is it better for applied physics. 

The physics major can be as easy or as difficult as you want it to be. It’s extremely flexible. You can do an inside concentration in physics or an outside concentration in whatever subject you want. 

AEP is also pretty flexible in that it’s mostly electives. So you can take whatever engineering classes you want to fill those. The physics major only counts classes from CAS though. That’s why I personally switched to AEP: wanted more engineering classes. 

I would choose AEP or physics based off of what kind of classes you want to take. Do you want engineering or arts electives?",0.3183,0.6071,0.0745

The professor is an old British chap. He's extremely quiet and difficult to hear. He just talks with like simple bullet points. He talks and talks and talks. Doesn't stop. He has no emotions in his voice. He makes the interesting topics really boring. You just have to sit there and try to stay awake and take notes. The only homework was to do the readings, however, the lectures were basically summaries of the reading. One of the books you must buy is written by him. The prelims are just short answers. If you can remember the information from lecture/textbooks, you'll do fine. However, he believes you need to do outstanding work to get an A. When I took it, the TA was really cool. He brought us to the rare manuscripts library to look at the actual books that we talk about in class which was actually really cool. The TA also had has write 3 short essays throughout the semester that would let us not take the final exam, which was more short answers. 

Overall, the professor was awful. However, the topics are actually interesting, but he somehow makes it not. If you don't go to lecture and just read, it's probably not too bad.

You're ethnically white or asian, and a male. You're skinny -- and I mean really skinny, as going to the gym or general exercise is not a priority for you (because obviously computer science is a way of life, and takes all your time). You come from a middle-upper-class household, with parents, at least one is in a STEM profession, and they helicopter parented you throughout middle school and high school.

You don't do very well with women, or men, in terms of romantic interests, and the majority of your friends are also in computer science because only they can tolerate your elitist beliefs and loner characteristics. You have few -- or no -- friends who lie outside the STEM majors.

You are also very insecure, and cling to your belief that by burying your head in your computer, programming a lot, you'll eventually ""show the world"" and all the ""haters"" will know you're superior.

I would talk to your advisor about this stuff though. As for what classes 2800 open up the door for, the only one you might actually feasibly take the semester immediately after is CS 4820, but you can easily fill in some other CS classes like 3110 or 3410 or some elective.

Personally I've talked to my advisor and there's no reason to rush ahead with this stuff and overload yourself.

16705,"CS major with stats minor will basically just be the CS major as a lot of the more applied stats courses are upper div and reserved for those in the major or have prerequisites you likely won't be able to get just through the minor.  However if your passions are more in CS definitely go for it!  The stats minor will still help you develop your talents, but only the electives will really teach you anything specific to stats instead of more generalized applications.  If you choose to go that route definitely make sure to take categorical data and linear models!",0.5726,0.3945,0.0329

16709,"Context: I'm a Master's Applied Stats major and didn't come here for undergrad.


A decent amount of the upper STSCI classes involve some type of programming so you'll definitely get the experience.  Plus if my program is any hint at how undergrad works, many of your elective courses can be from CS and count for STSCI and vice versa.  As far as double majoring goes, I'd recommend chatting with advisors or any of the recruitment contacts you may have since I don't know how hard it may be at Cornell.


However, I did do a Computational Statistics major at my undergraduate and I can tell you that even if you don't get the fancy double major, any stats program emphasizing programming and CS is the best thing for our field right now.  I can't reccomend pursuing CS along stats enough!  Don't sweat it if they tell you it may be too difficult to do in 4 years, you can make that choice yourself.  But know that the skills you acquire by just taking a few CS courses will put you above a lot of other pure stats and math majors and will help you later in your stats career.  Best of luck!!!


Edit: Forgot to mention the professors!  So far I've really enjoyed all the ones I've met.  Melissa Smith is fantastic at giving you real world examples and applied statistical problems.  Xialong Yang is MVP but his classes are rigorous.  Giles Hooker is hilarious and everyone's favorite.  Joe Guiness is new but a very effective and engaging lecturer.  And the list goes on.  Compared to my old university, the stats professors here clearly care and make it a point to show you how you're going to be using these skills in the real world!",0.9156,0.0744,0.01

It's mainly about having experience to get that first round coding challenge and after that it's about being able to pass the technical interview.

Some non-tech companies (and some large tech companies like Google) have a benchmark between 3.0-3.3. So I'd say you're golden at a 3.3, but honestly even if you're lower it doesn't matter. Only HR may potentially even look at your GPA but at most companies they won't bother.

Edit: Also after you get your first full time offer your GPA literally doesn't count for shit. Don't even bother putting it on there even if it's a 4.3. So don't worry about your GPA, it doesn't really matter while you're in college and it'll matter even less upon graduation.",0.1431,0.486,0.3709

The main things you'll need to know from 3300 are what a linear program is and how to formulate one. Occasionally, you might need a little bit of the theory from 3300 (like what weak/strong duality is), but you can teach yourself the theory as you go along - you don't need it so much that it becomes hard to keep up. 

AMPL is much the same- when I took 3300, we didn't really use it that much, and I didn't quite understand it- we use it much more in 3310, and you'll probably have a recitation on it in the beginning of the semester - you'll be able to keep up with it.

From the article:
Cornell remains the only Ivy League school to house all three ROTC programs, in the Army, Navy and Air Force. In addition, the university partners with the Warrior-Scholar Project to help current and former enlisted service members prepare for college, and its Veterans Summer Bridge program helps student veterans gain a supportive foundation for the rest of their academic experience at Cornell, said Provost Michael Kotlikoff.

“We recognize that, through military service, veterans have gained maturity, skills, self-discipline and experiences that prepare them both to succeed academically and to contribute to our campus community,” said Kotlikoff, who noted that his daughter serves in the U.S. Navy on active duty. “All of us benefit from the particular backgrounds and perspectives that veterans bring to campus, and we are proud to welcome them to Cornell.”",0.7716,0.2184,0.01

The school can be a beast. However, your ability to speak on any level with any person after you graduate is a priceless commodity - regardless of the grades you leave with. 

If you are feeling like this on your first snowy week please get some mental health assistance. You can call  607-255-5155 or visit https://health.cornell.edu/services/mental-health-care

When I was a student I called the number. I wasn't crazy or depressed or suicidal or anything. I just needed some clarity on my thoughts and they were able to give me some smart guidance that made a big difference for me. I only called that one time in 4 years  but it was so well worth it.

Good luck neophyte! Remember, there are many there that feel just as you do at this very moment.

I think he's an absolutely fantastic instructor. He's really devoted to helping you truly understand the content, especially if you're interested in it at all. He tries to explain everything explicitly in a pretty organized, logical way, and if he skips a step and you get confused, he'll talk about it and clarify without any hesitation. 

He's also just a generally fun guy who dresses up for Halloween, puts on a bow tie basically every day, and if you go to his office hours there's a tiny chance he'll offer you a shot of espresso. 

I would say that he makes the 4130 psets pretty challenging, but in a good way. He also loves to provide intuition for things in class, and often explains things visually before proving a theorem more rigorously. He's very open to in-class questions (but this may be different for a class larger than 20-30 kids, I dunno), doesn't treat anybody like they're stupid, and openly admits to his mistakes.",0.8763,0.1095,0.0142

Shit was a depressing time, I feared that my aid would stop and I’d be kicked out (My family was poor so received full aid, without all the aid there’s 0% chance of me continuing Cornell). Anyways, I was in probation spring of freshman year and I barely, and I mean barely got above the probation gpa requirement. Halfway through the semester I thought I would fail my classes, but I started speaking with the professors and they understood my situation and I tried my best, they might’ve helped me out too but the point is to talk to them, let them know your situation and what you can do now to pass. Please reach out to your professor, the grade you have now can be very different if you take the initiative to speak with them and of course continue to get better and go to office hours. I can’t answer your questions about aid because I did not go into probation ever again after that but I would assume that you could still get the grant money at least from Cornell, but that’s a question for fin aid department. 

Just to finish the story, one of the main reason I did poorly was because I did not enjoy my major and I suffered through imposter syndrome (still do), I worked with the career team in CALS and started taking courses in another major, I was actually in interdisciplinary major until the senior year when I officially made the switch to a STEM major and graduated. Just know that if I could do it, so can you, trust me my SAT is probably lower than yours (not that it says everything about a person). 

Go to professors, go to Cornell health, go to office hours, meet with CALS advisors regularly to seek guidance if you think the major isn’t the right fit. Worry about things that you can control, as in the grades in your classes from now to end of semester.

For lewis structures with more than one central atom like the H3CCO2-, I start by making 2d model that just shows where to put the atoms and bonds. https://i.imgur.com/pvlTfyA.jpg
Usually reading the formula left to right will tell u the order of the atoms. 
Hydrogens typically bond with the carbons so that is why I put them around the carbon. 
In the formula the first C is followed by another C so I bonded the second carbon to the carbon with the hydrogens. 
The oxygens is where it starts to get tricky. This is when I start thinking about how many bonds does each atom need to achieve a charge that will add up to the charge of the molecule. 
Carbon needs four bonds to be neutral. The second carbon already has 1 bond from the first carbon, and to get it neutral I need 3 more. I have 2 oxygens left which means one will have to make a double bond and the other will make a single bond to add up to the 3 needed to make carbon neutral. 
O is neutral when it has 2 bonds and -1 when it has 1 bond. 
The first O is neutral and the second O gives the minus charge needed to match the charge of the molecule. 
Now that the 2D structure is done you can determine the steric numbers of any atom that is bonded to 2 or more other atoms to determine the 3D shape. In this case, I would determine the steric numbers of both the carbons by counting the bonds they have because they are the only atoms bonded to at least 2 other ones. https://i.imgur.com/ML47YBj.jpg
Once those steric numbers are found u can draw the 3D structure. 
As for knowing when to put in rings: basically it’s just making sure the atoms have enough bonds to be neutral. For S5, if they were drawn in a line, 2 S’s wouldnt get the number of bonds they need to stay neutral. S needs 2 bonds to be neutral. By drawing them in a ring you are able to get every S to have 2 bonds thereby keeping them neutral and keeping the molecule neutral",0.1069,0.7336,0.1595

17848,"I've had a lot of issues with the course structure as a whole.

I feel that the discussions are just me twiddling my thumbs, or now that the sheet has to be done in class, just writing some bs to hand in at the end.

Office hours (I went at the beginning of the semester so idk how they are now) are crowded of course, it's hard when it's a class of this size but it feels like I just sit there until the TA writes some prophetic line on the whiteboard that'll serve as a hint. I think students would be much better served with no discussions and having those TAs devote time to office hours instead.

The lectures are hard to look back on due to Michael George's course note style.

The one redeeming factor is that some of the material is well-explained on the course website, but it's hit or miss. I did not understand induction until I looked up example problems online, but that's not always possible with more niche topics. 

I guess the biggest suggestion I could give is to give more problems to practice what I know. Obviously you can't ask an RSA question a million times, but I feel that there's a huge disconnect between lectures and homeworks and it'd be very helpful if I could connect lecture material with practice problems that could give me a better idea of what I'm doing on the HW.

The hardest thing I think with 2800 is not the workload or pure difficulty of the material, it's the fact that the material sort of exists in its own little bubble and if you don't understand it the first time it's been explained, you're sort of left in the dust. That's why I think practice problems would be very helpful. This also goes for more concrete examples to sort of ""verify"" abstract proofs.",0.1165,0.4017,0.4819

While I loved the class and material, that was mostly due to hours of digging through the course website (which is amazing in my opinion). I think more realistic expectations for what students new to proofs can understand in a given time, and possibly more structured lectures in terms of allowing students to practice writing a basic proof before Professor George goes about solving something super complex that would often go way over my head in lecture.

The only category of class in the chemistry major I haven't taken is inorganic chem (metal chemistry) because my major doesn't require it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Unless you really love chemistry, I would steer really far away from the chemistry major. 

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, the department is in shambles. No professor teaches the same class for more than two years in a row. The intro level courses are all rotated between a panel/group of qualified instructors who don't care much for teaching the class (generally). Every once in a while you'll get a really good instructor (like Dr. Lancaster for gen chem) but most of the time the people teaching the classes don't really want to be there; they're just forced to teach it as per department policy.

&amp;#x200B;

Research opportunities are really good though and that's the bread and butter of the chemistry department and what makes them a top 15 chemistry program in the country. Do understand, however, that the quality of the undergraduate education (which is what should ultimately matter the most to you) is INCREDIBLY hit or miss.

2. As for snowy boots, these are a problem in nearly every building, whether the floor is grated or not. Let me ask you, how often do you actually walk through the snow at Cornell. I usually walk through paths that are salted and plowed. And by the time you enter the building, wipe your shoes go up a step of floors go up two floors in the stacks, your boots probably are not dripping. But let’s say they are still wet, and then the water slowly glides down the metal grating and condenses into a drop large enough to fall.

My advice is to join a club or an organization that you feel you have even a little bit of a remote interest in. It's honestly not too late to join a club at this point of the semester as long as you reach out to the leaders (via text or email) and ask when the next meeting is, as long as there are no interviews / applications involved! I know that it can be super hard approaching someone at first, and also trying to build up a friendship w/ a person who doesn't want to pursue it, but don't let failures keep you down for too long. There are a heck of a lot of people here at Cornell, so with trial and error, you will find the right people for you.

Try to keep positive; you still have one whole semester next year to have more opportunities to hop between clubs and/or groups–try not to think of it as another semester of worries and stress but of new chances. I know with it being the final run until break and then finals coming up, it must be hard, but try to force yourself to look at the brighter side of things in every situation that you encounter.

That being said, I do think there are a decent amount of opportunities for you to make friends here. I started to get involved with some groups over the summer through Instagram, Snapchat, and GroupMe. It was nice being able to see some familiar faces on campus from the first day I got here. I highly recommend doing this (for context, I joined an LGBT group chat and one for my dorm). Also, if you know you’re shy, I recommend joining a club/group on campus as soon as you can. I joined band, and I’m very glad I did because  it’s a very welcoming atmosphere and there’s always social events going on. There’s lots to do here, so I’m sure you can find something you like. 

I do regret not being more outgoing during O-week, as this is probably the only time where you can basically walk up to anyone and try to get to know them a bit. Do some of the cheesy O-week events, and definitely don’t keep yourself cooped up in your dorm.

for an FWS it's actually an above-average time commitment imo (constant readings-- two short-ish books, many articles, and two movies) but I stayed because I found all the content interesting. I think # of essays is standard for all FWS, iirc we had 5 and each went through at least one revision. I thought grading was fair because we had grade estimates for each essay and a fair shot at raising our grades through the revisions, and we compile a midterm and final portfolio w the revisions and a reflection that serves as a good chunk of our grade

will definitely say that the class is a popular choice, but people also drop the class pretty quickly upon seeing the syllabus/courseload. if you're interested, definitely take it; if you just want a chill FWS, don't",0.6667,0.3043,0.029

**Things I didn't know about Cornell that now I do:** Cornell isn't a good school to be a premed, apparently.   
  
**Finaid:**  
 * You need to fill out the CSS and FAFSA which are available from collegeboard.   
 * You will receive shittier financial aid than most other comparable schools (i.e. other Ivies, Duke, Stanford, etc.) if you make between 60-250k - below that you'll get full anywhere and above you'll get nothing anywhere.   
 * Make sure you apply to a shit ton of other places, fit doesn't matter at all if you can't afford the places you get into. The cost of application is negligible compared to the amount of money you can save.   
 * Also Cornell has special scholarships like the Rawlings Scholarship that a very small percentage of students get, which covers maybe 1k. 
 * IF YOU HAVE OUTSIDE SCHOLARSHIPS, DO YOUR BEST TO GET THEM PAID TO YOU DIRECTLY. If you report them to Cornell, it will be deducted from your GRANT aid, i.e. the free money that Cornell gives you. This is bullshit and you should try to avoid it if possible.

I'm pretty quiet/introverted, not really one for parties or being particularly outgoing, and freshman year here was a really great social experience. Definitely second the other comment here about putting effort into going to O-week stuff, since everyone is trying to get to know people and it's before any friend groups really start to solidify, so it's much easier to meet and connect with people. 

That being said, don't feel terrible if you don't click with people you meet during O-week. I still talk to/am close with people I met then, but my core friend group was formed largely because we all lived in the same building freshman year.

18587,"Imo there is stress at every college. Also, there is so much more that is great about Cornell than there isn’t — it’s really all about how you approach your lifestyle at Cornell.  

Obviously there is no big city atmosphere, which is something most people complain about in terms of how the lack of which emphasizes the cornell “bubble,” but to them i say it is really what you make of it (your attitude, also the fact that you ultimately chose to study here) that matters! 
Personally, I came from a pretty small suburb that has a similar feel to outer Ithaca. To me, the addition of campus activities and overall diversity of individuals on campus is enough to make my time at Cornell (thus, Ithaca) extremely stimulating. It also helps to remember that there are so many nooks and crannies (events, festivals, shops, restaurants, hiking trails, nature preserves) within Ithaca waiting for you to explore. There is much to keep you busy, both on campus and off, it’s just that off campus life especially is at an overall slower pace than in a big city. It’s got its own charm though :) 

Back to Cornell and whether or not it is brutal: it’s all relative! The biomed student may have a more rigorous course load than the gender studies student but what you do on your own time with regards to your unique course load + your motivation to do well + your time spent on extracurriculars determines how brutal Cornell will be for you. If you are a naturally high achiever (which I’m assuming you are since you are interested in Cornell) of course you will put more stress on yourself to succeed, and stress out when success maybe isn’t handed to you initially. To these people, it will be brutal yes but that’s a given. Expect this phenomenon to be True across majors, across colleges, and across all universities outside of Cornell. Which is why a biomed student may or may not have it more brutal than a gender studies student - likewise why a cornell student may or may not have it more brutal than a student of any other university. How brutal something is, including studying at Cornell, comes down to you.",0.4029,0.4771,0.12

In particular, I didn't find Cornell to be especially oppressive when I was an undergrad, and I had a pretty heavy schedule most semesters. For AEM/CS specifically, AEM is probably the easiest major here and shouldn't be stressful at all. CS is also far from the hardest engineering major - but there are all sorts of reasons people might not have a good time. For example, CS in engineering makes you take all these engineering requirements that many CS majors might hate because they're irrelevant for a job. Or you might overestimate how capable you are and sign up for too heavy a schedule, and want to continue because of inertia from  high school. Overall it requires adaptation, but I wouldn't consider Cornell that depressing an environment in particular - these things are just a manifestation of problems that every university in the nation is suffering from currently.",0.0491,0.276,0.675

That analogy makes absolutely no sense that I don't even know where to start. If you would like me to entertain such an absurd analogy, kindly explain how each part relates to my suggestions.

Here's a better analogy: Some people at the Charlottesville Rally proclaim to have just been there to peacefully protest the taking down of statues. But other participants decided to turn violent, ultimately killing a young woman. Should the non-violent protesters denounce the killing/violence that occurred? Should the peacefil participants help authorities in bringing the violent ones to justice? Should non-violent protesters deassociate with violent ones by organizing their own events and ensuring peacefulness to the best of their ability? I think yes. 

&gt; Here's what so-called peaceful protesters should do: protest PEACEFULLY

18734,"1. You aren't smart and capable. Those are just words that tell you you don't need to work as hard as other people. That's a shit attitude to have and people telling you that is completely unhelpful. It's good you've already realized this.     
2. You will be successful in college only when you find out what you want out of it. Do you need to make a shitton of money out of graduation? Do CS or finance. Want to contribute to a mass political movement? Maybe a government minor. Want to network with a ton of people and set up a career based on social interaction? Maybe AEM or SHA. You should ask yourself these questions now. If what you want out of college is to breeze through all your classes and have a good time, engineering is not for you. I suspect that is not what you want. Be realistic, with both your goals and constraints, and make sure you really know what you want, with all the consequences attached.  
3. Once you find out what you want to do, make a real plan to get there. Maybe it doesn't require you to take as many courses. Maybe it does, but once you're committed it will be easier. The important thing is to know what you want, define your goals, and convince yourself that you really want that. And to be willing to change your mind if that turns out not to be the case, if at all possible.   
4. Next step, find out what you don't care about. Everybody on campus has things they're doing through inertia that contribute nothing to their life. For example, clubs you don't really give a shit about that you're in anyways. Or obligations that you feel you have to other people, that they couldn't care less about you doing, again typically in a club. People make all sorts of excuses about why they need to do this or that when neither they nor the person they're working with need them to be doing it. Identify these things as potential blocks for saving time.   
5. If you've done all that, the last thing is to prioritize. Now that you know what matters to you and what doesn't matter, you know how you can get your maximum output.   
6. At the end of the day, no one cares about your grades, especially in CS. If you're happy going into CS and making 100k+ out of college, consider this as a possible option that lets you do whatever else you want in college, which is not likely to become obsolete any time soon (maybe less highly valued, but you'll get by).

1) this is one of the best educations you can get in the country, maybe even the world. With that being said, the coursework and grading criteria are EXTREMELY difficult. So be prepared for that.

2) no, it's not as brutal as this sub makes it out to be, because it's not this bad *all the time*. Some days/weeks/semesters are incredibly difficult and miserable. You need to be mentally prepared for how miserable it will get sometimes, and recognize that it won't be that miserable forever.

3) it can seem really isolating socially. Until you find a group you mesh with, it can seem like everyone has friends except for you.  give it time, try out different clubs, and be patient. Your future friends are probably super lonely too.

4) for me, everyone sharing their struggles on this sub gives me a sense of comradry in a weird way. Somehow knowing others are struggling makes me feel like my struggles are more justified, thus easing the load.



Tldr: Cornell has good days and bad days, which comes with the territory of such a quality education. Be prepared for the mental turmoil it will put you through, and remember it WILL get better, and if you're struggling, others are too. Even if you don't see it.",0.2206,0.4372,0.3422

If you have something other than studies that is distracting you and hard to resolve on your own, maybe try to take a break and talk to your closed ones or use one of the mental health resources on campus?

If all that's True, then you should definitely take a look into the ""getting used to college"" aspect you mentioned below.  The exam culture at Cornell is unique to say the least, given our strange prelim schedules, and it takes a lot of getting used to.  My freshman year, I began practicing mindfulness meditation in conjunction with studying and it really helped me with my exam performance, both in and out of Engineering classes.

Studying under exam-like conditions is also a really good idea.  Say, go to a decently quiet library space, try your hand at 2-3 practice problems in complete silence without textbooks or computers, then grade yourself.

Everyone gets stressed out by the exam room, and everyone taking an exam with you is just as anxious as you are.  Like others have said, if you're here then you're smart enough to be here.  I've never known an exception to this in my 3 years here.

edit: from a more practical perspective, considering your situation, I'd recommend speaking to the professor and explaining your situation, asking about a late drop option, and trying to take 1920 again next semester.

Second, I know that it can be tough and a lot of Cornell is toxic. But there are also a lot of good people out there. You just have to search for them.

“Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you” (Mathew 7:7).

This has been my favorite verse for a while now. Cornell is disheartening, but there are many instances where when I needed help and if I keep on asking, someone is kind enough to provide. And when I ask God for help, he provides in many wonderful ways too.

I guess you might know what’s coming but I suggest going to a church (if your not going to one that is). I actually became Christian when I got to Cornell and started going to church for the first time in my life. It has really helped me transition (I’m from Hawaii so you can imagine the change) and the amount of spiritual and emotional support has pushed me through some difficulties.

The church I go to is Fist Ithaca Chinese Christian Church. The bus to take you there comes at 9:35 at college town. I’m usually there wearing a red scarf.

The thing that sucks is that when you get into the real world, you'll realize that so many places are either like this or provide no opportunity for advancement.

Instead of the Boomers marching on Wall Street, where their WEALTH could bring down any broker the Boomers chose to boycott, they were marched off to WADC in a feckless Carnival Cruise picketing farce. Instead of the Millennials marching on WADC, where their Woodstockian tatts, drugs and face paint would have brought Congress to a screeching halt, they were marched off to Wall Street in a feckless reprise of MLKs Give Us Free!, as brokers LITERALLY piissed down onto them.

That was $23,000 BILLION down the Deep State rabbit hole, ago. The TOTAL of all US Worker Wealth is only $31,000 BILLION. We're only a year or two from ZERO.

So HK. What was HK about? HK was about China requesting extradition rights the same as US is using to rendition Assange. Why would they do that? Because HK is a tax haven for fleeing Chinese Slave Lords and their BILLIONS. They flee to HK and run their massive global money-laundering and R / E investing criminal operations. HK is the finance version of Medellin drug cartels in Colombia. Xi tried to stop the run.

The Deep State seized the controlled dissent consensus reality. It's like baking Yellow Cake now. It's the Flower Revolution, metastasized on a global scale. So CIA and MI6 planted operatives in the street, EXACTLY like Maidan overthrow by the illegal dual-Isareli Junta Coup, and those operatives turned it into a Student Revolt. Students are useful to Deep State that way. Uneducated, inexperienced, incapable of independent thought. HK is just another Globalist Billionaire NeoCon beachhead.

Hey, it worked for Ukraine! Hillary and Kerry spirited $FORTY BILLION of our last life savings off to the illegal dual-Isareli Junta Coup leaders and they made off with it!!

19291," I was in your place a year ago! I also spent a lot of time on this subreddit and it made me very apprehensive about my chances of doing well here and enjoying it. 

The truth is, as other comments have mentioned, few people going to post about how wonderful their day was, how interesting their lecture was, how fantastic they did on a prelim. People are often very concerned with how they *seem* to others (how capable, how successful), and so relegate their venting to the anonymity of the Internet. Which is fine, of course. We all need to vent. Just don't let what you read on here jade you! Not every day is going to be amazing, but odds are you won't be miserable here, and the odds are that even the most unhappy posters here aren't miserable all the time. No experience is universal. 

Personally, my social life isn't as amazing as I'd hoped, and sometimes (particularly at the beginning of the semester) I have felt overwhelmed and doubted whether I belonged here. Competition can increase periodically in certain classes, and otherwise mature people make rude or passive aggressive remarks about how 'stupid' some of their classmates are; there's a percentage of very intelligent people here with an underdeveloped sense of empathy. 

With that said, I really do love Cornell, and all of my friends do as well! I genuinely love learning and I think anyone who does can do well and enjoy it here. I love the beautiful campus; one of my favorite parts of the day is just putting some good music on and walking to class, even when it's chilly and snowy.  I love meeting people who want to be entrepreneurs in other countries, solve social issues, start their own farms, work on artificial intelligence -- anything you can imagine. People are still idealists at this early stage, and there's nothing half so wonderful as meeting people that have managed to hold onto their big dreams. And, for the record, *most* people here are pretty nice. I love the professors; obviously not all of them are great, but the ones you can have real conversations with and learn from are some of the most interesting people I've met. I love the academic independence in choosing classes (although this varies by major, as some of my friends are really stuck in prereqs right now). 

Just remember that, if you do get into Cornell and you do have low points or moments of doubt (as you will, we all do!) or feel stressed out by a big test or something like that, there's always people who are willing to talk to you. Don't isolate yourself, because you don't have to. We all go through the same stuff and can relate to and uplift each other. College is hard and never what you expect, but it doesn't have to be horrible! In my experience, every day has a bit of both, and even overwhelming events/assignments/experiences end up being fine and are quickly forgotten. I just appreciate the little things (nice weather, friends, weekends), go to class, and do (mostly) whatever I feel like, and I'm enjoying it overall. Good luck with ED!

19302,"Hello all! I’m currently a sophomore at a community college and am in the process of applying to schools to transfer to for Fall 2020. For a few months, Cornell had been sending me emails encouraging me to apply. I just brushed it off because I didn’t feel I had any chance of every getting into an Ivy League school. Then this week they sent a letter to my house saying they’re looking for transfer students to apply... so I decided to go for it. I’m enrolled in my college’s honors program where I’ve taken more than the required honors level courses and I’m also a member of Phi Theta Kappa (it’s an honors society). I have a 3.75 GPA right now and as of right now it’s looking like I should finish this semester with 4 A’s and 2 A-‘s, so my GPA should increase. I’m a female political science major and I intend to go to law school. I asked my honors Irish literature professor who is also our honors program director to write my letter of recommendation and I’m waiting to hear back from her. What would you say the chances of me getting in is? I don’t really expect to, so I’m not getting my hopes up too much. Are there any tips you’d suggest? I didn’t do great on my SAT in high school, I got like a 1090. I think it was like a 600 something on the reading portion and 400 on the math (I really, REALLY am terrible at math. That’s my biggest downfall). I haven’t submitted my application yet because I’m waiting for my professor to confirm she’s going to write my letter of recommendation.

2. One driver stopped to make sure an older lady got to her apartment in Titus Tower because an ambulance was blocking his entrance.
3. When the display couldn't show the coming stops, a driver announced them for the passengers.
4. The drivers are kind enough not to yell at people to crowd up when more people need to and can get on the bus.
5. If you're traveling on the 17 after hours, they will drop you close to where you live.
6. When my TCAT pass connected to my Cornell ID didn't work, multiple drivers took it on faith that I was a paying customer.

19463,"Let's assume you got 95% average on homework and quizzes. Together that's 20% of your grade so 0.2 \* 95 = 19.  
First prelim you got standard deviation below the median, a general guideline (albeit not 100% accurate) is 1 standard deviation below the median is a letter grade. So let's say you got a C on that prelim, which was 22.5% of your grade. 0.225\*75 = 16.87  
Second prelim you got the median which is a B so 0.225\*85 = 19.125  
So your grade so far is 19 + 16.87 + 19.125 =  54.995%.  
In order to get a B+ you want about an 87%. 87 - 54.995 =  32.005. So you need about 32 more points on your average to finish the class with a B+  
This can be done with an A on the final since .35\*95 = 33.25 (this doesn't mean you NEED an A, remember these are all just estimates and guidelines, but an A would get you a B+ by these estimates).

Unfortunately, you are right, I see science losing its passion here as it slowly becomes a bunch of exams. And what's worse is professors caring about the exam grades. Comparing it to my undergrad, where curious people were encouraged and their motivation was nurtured, it's all lost here. I'd thought of leaving, too. And I almost did. Just in time, a very nice professor gave me something really cool. Not my area of expertise, far from what I wanted to do, but I got something that I'm moderately happy with. But, what I'm trying to say is, hold on as much as you can. You never know when you'll find something you're really passionate about doing, that takes your mind off all this. You're a junior now, it's not that long now. Just hold on. Things will get better. If not, you'll realise you can land on your feet one way or another. 

If you're so far out that you can't take it anymore, exploring other possibilities won't hurt. There are these advising staff in Caldwell Hall, I think. As for therapy, if you're not happy with your psychologist, maybe group therapy might interest you. You might meet others with the same views, hopefully you won't feel alone.

And I hope, rather I'm sure that you'll make the most of what you can here and come out the other side .

Am one of the mods. Will say that it's been tough keeping up with it because people spam hard and also Facebook's display algorithm doesn't show the posts in the same order to everyone anymore.

19507,"Kinda. They have different goals. A&amp;S physics is more focused on building a super solid foundation for graduate work. The vast majority of students in A&amp;S continue onto graduate study. Quantum is such a cornerstone of pretty much every upper division course (and pretty much every graduate area) that it is imperative that the foundation is solid. Formulation is important understanding why and how the field developed is important understanding quantum at a deep and fundamental level is important. It needs to be as familiar to you as riding a bike and you need to know exactly how to repair the bike and modify it to suit your needs. 

AEP is way more about “useful” physics. There is a lot of stuff that you can sweep under the rug or not think super hard about and still come up with a useful system. There is nothing wrong with this. You can still speak English perfectly well without understanding the exact nuances of grammar. They care a lot more about being able to solve practicle problems and apply quantum to real world systems. The formulation is less important and deep understanding isn’t really needed. They just need to know how to ride a bike not fix it. 

That being said I had a couple AEP students with me in upper division physics courses. They did fine but some of the more theoretical discussions where hard for them. They tended to need more time on problem sets for problems that hadnt seen before and had a harder time coming up with creative solutions to problems. They wiped the floor with us when it came time to solve relitivly stright forward “real world” problems. 

This is also a huge generalization and not True for every student in each class. But as a general rule arts cares more about why and aep cares about how. If you don’t want to go to graduate school it is way easier to get hired with an aep degree. It’s harder to get into graduate school without the more “rigorous” physics department courses.",0.2495,0.4935,0.257

There are a lot of people here who value prestige over everything else and will try to brag and one-up everyone, especially within our major. I was really depressed my first couple years here and felt major imposter syndrome. But I can promise you there are many people at this school (and in CS) who care about more than getting a job at a name brand company and will genuinely empathize with what you are going through. There are kind people out there, but if you don’t go to club meetings or hang out with people and generally keep to yourself, it’s easy not to find these people. A lot of my friends are also in CS and we all support each other and congratulate each other on our successes. We help each other with classes we are struggling in without expecting much in return. There are some great people in our major who love software engineering and learning and aren’t just out to win some social competition.

19537,"I would say that culture is very different between the three schools. Econ in arts is very much like a typical college experience, in that your another major in a big school. As well, you have common core prerequisites to fulfill, most notably a language requirement. 

With Dyson and hotel, both are much more tight knit in that the school is smaller, and the students have multiple classes together early on as our credits are fairly front-loaded. We end up having multiple classes with the same group of kids, which I love because it’s super easy to make friends within the school.

Dyson specifically is just finance oriented, but I have friends in Dyson who are entering venture capital, marketing, and consulting (and IB ofc). In hotel, about a third of graduates enter finance. Related fields. Many others enter real estate, as we have a very well developed program, and the commercial real estate market at a macro level is dominated by Cornell and Penn alumni. As for the hospitality industry, SHA is the one and only (and if you have any interest or see a prospective future in it at all, I would heavily consider hotel). 

Lastly, I would bring it back to the school’s culture. Hotel of course is super tight knit, and everyone in the school is really nice, still haven’t met a single Hotelie that I couldn’t find a way to like or admire. “Dyson snakes” exist, I wouldn’t say it’s the majority but my friends tell me that it feels very cut throat, and that aside from the friends that you really trust, competition is at the forefront of everyone’s mind. I don’t know much about A&amp;S Econ, but I think if you want a more expansive liberal arts education, then I would consider its otherwise, Dyson or Hotel would be my pick any day over Arts.",0.7158,0.2564,0.0278

It's the point in the semester where paying attention in lecture becomes near impossible and people start doing their best to just stay afloat. You are absolutely not alone in that. I had a really tough time trying to make friends through CS classes, the lectures are too massive and the average CS major is generally pretty introverted which makes it hard to make meaningful connections. Most of my friends came from outside of CS but over time I've definitely made a few great CS friends as well. Imposter syndrome is especially prevalent among CS majors and you have to remind yourself that there are a ton of people that feel exactly the same as you do rn. You really just have to put yourself out there and try to meet people and not be afraid of being rejected. Joining other clubs and having non coding hobbies will also make a world of difference. Along the same lines, you dont have to take super heavy semesters loaded with CS classes even if it seems like everyone else is. Try to find at least 1 class that you are genuinely interested in and seems like fun every semester.

I think the most important thing is to start early. That way you can get all the help you need quickly. When it gets close to the deadline office hour waiting times are insane. In my experience the course staff are super helpful and will take time to explain concepts to you and walk you through the assignments.

For prelims, I find that the tests match the previous tests very closely. I usually do all the prelims before exams then review my mistakes. Since the problems usually match up exactly I find that it helps to make a bulleted list of all the stuff I often miss on a particular problem then memorize that list so I don't make the same mistakes. I also go over the terms on the study guide and find examples of concepts I'm confused about either on the lecture examples or the labs/assignments.

Don't let a few bad prelim scores get you down. Keep trying and finding new ways to study.

I do not know if the term 'Cornell Face' has been coined yet, but it is definitely a thing. Very few people are open to others, even their close friends, about their failures. If you ask someone how they did on a pset or an exam they'll almost always respond with something like ""eh I did okay"" if they failed.

There's nothing holding us back except for the thoughts we let fill our mind and set limitations on ourselves.  it may be hard at first, and certainly won't all be done in a hot minute. but i realized just that change in mindset added enough fuel to my day to get me somewhere, if only out of bed. wishing you well. also, i'm a freshman in cs 1110 too so if you ever need a buddy lmk.",0.4414,0.3885,0.1701

19886,"Chance me: I am a white female political science major at a community college in Pennsylvania hoping to transfer for Fall 2020 as a Government major,

\- I am in my school's Honors Program and have taken more than the recommended honors courses and have had A's in all of them, although I may finish with a B+ or A- in my honors Irish literature class this semester.

\- I am a member of Phi Theta Kappa which is an international honors society for two year schools

\- GPA: 3.75, hopefully will go up at the end of this semester

\- My SAT score was a 1090 (490 on math, 600 on reading) which I know that sucks but that was my junior year of HS and I'm in my second year of college now

\- I am currently a volunteer janitor at my church and honorary member of a volunteer fire company so I have volunteer hours

\- If they pay any attention to high school, I gave a speech in front of my whole school for National Walk Out Day and participated in cheerleading 

\- Took AP European History and got a 4

\- Hoping to secure a recommendation from my honors program director who is also my professor currently

At the end of the day, what matters most is being passionate and *really* liking the school (which it seems to me you have on lock).

Of course, all of this is dependent on if you can *convey* these things, so make sure you put time into your essays when the time comes around. 

For now, stick with what you love and work on your credentials (you don’t need 750s on everything but it would definitely help). Over however much time you have until applications, try to demonstrate interest somehow and tie yourself with the school (meet a professor, do a summer program, visit a few times, get to know the college fair rep).

I did all my things as a sophomore transfer and I could have still graduated a semester early so take that as you will. I think you get more exposure to law in ILR as compared to A&amp;S gov and like i said, you already do get political exposure in most ILR classes. Labor relations is only one piece of the curriculum though (although those classes do cover relevant things like minimum wage, corporate political donations, elections, unions, human rights, etc) 

As for government minors I would look into A&amp;S minors and see if there are any you could feasibly do if you were ILR (I’m sure there are a few as many of the classes crosslist).

It’s a labor and employment major that covers all aspects of developments in the field and it is actually very related to politics and less related to business. In fact, I only took business classes because the business minor is easy to get as an ILR student. Many ILR students actually end up taking government or other law classes since the major has relatively few requirements and gives you a lot of freedom to explore. I was law oriented and took labor and employment law, international labor law, public sector labor law, and disability law within ILR, but also had time to take real estate law, death penalty law, and constitutional law and politics. Many of these classes obviously cover a lot of government/politics related subject matter as well since they’re constantly developing based on the political system. I could have also subbed out a few of those classes for government specific ones in A&amp;S if I had wanted to.

Lol anyways, putting your saltiness aside. You’re right, academics ain’t everything, you gotta prove to them why you belong there if your academic isn’t on par or why you did your best with what you have/had. Maybe you grew up poor because that’s just the luck of the draw and you personally didn’t choose that, not gonna go much into it but being poor directly correlates with lower SAT scores, hard to focus on SAT scores when you have to attend your local HS with no funding and have to work on the side, but whatever. You’re right again, I am a dumbass, but thanks to Cornell I graduated in 4 years with no debt under my name and now support my family with a great job, wouldn’t have happened if Cornell didn’t take a chance on a dumbass like me. I know many people in the “poor” program you’re referring to that are now working in some great places, like one of buddy working at Google, a lot of smart people, maybe it doesn’t seem that way because poor people don’t fit the Cornell mold. 

As for PSP, that’s actually not the program you’re referring to, PSP can technically be attended by people that aren’t required to, you’re referring to E/HEOP.

I find the concepts all make sense and I'm pretty confident in my understanding of them, but when it comes to the nittt-gritty of parsing the questions and doing the proofs the right way I keep getting it wrong. I really wish this course followed a text book rather than the in-class chicken scratch slides.

On the brighter side, I've spoken to people who have graduated and they say you'll never really need this stuff again. I think there's a big difference in being able to understand the concepts and apply them vs. doing theoretical proofs. 

I'm not letting this course discourage me. I don't think it's representative of all CS courses. And from other threads, I think a generous curve and an attendance grade will get me my C. Of course I could be as wrong on these assumptions as I have been on all my CS2800 answers..

I am however taking this course as an indication that in the future I should stick to applied programming courses and steer clear of the theoretical math classes.

You may start at precisely 4:00 PM on Friday, October 9th 2020. You must report to your academic advisor to sign up for physics research no later than December 8th. Other fields have their deadlines listed on their department website. During your sign up, you will be assigned both a professor and a field of physics to do research in. Should you be dissatisfied with your assignment, you may appeal after 2 months of doing research under the professor. 

In all seriousness though, just look up professors in the AEP and physics departments and email those you are interested in working with that you’d like to talk to them about their research. The vast majority will not respond, so after about 3 emails, go knock on their door. Many don’t respond as a matter of principle to see who is really interested.",0.0664,0.5221,0.4115

I have never found a math course to be as difficult as cs 2800. The class has so many problems that I could make my own 2000 word rant on the topic if I wanted to. The biggest issue is that all the office hours are literally out the door and the TAs aren't given solutions nor are they even allowed to look at your paper to see if you are on track.

Also a lot of cs students struggle with this course, so if you do end up getting below a c, don’t let it discourage you...

I would take a class like 2110 or 3110 to really chose.

I think you can definitely do waves and quantum concurrently.

Taking quantum earlier also enables you to take grad quantum more easily, which is an interesting course you may want to consider based on your research interests.

I'm also not sure about your seniors fall - seems a bit heavy and I'm pretty sure quantum computing isn't offered in spring in general. My advice would maybe be to switch advanced lab and apps of quantum, drop Combo and particle, take the 2-semester GR sequence, and see if you can somehow get intermediate quantum earlier.

20310,"Quantum and waves concurrently should be fine. Solid state, I would recommend learning definitely **after** advanced quantum (P4443).  CS2800 is definitely a class worth taking. I am biased though, towards CS rather than Mathematics. I think for physics at least, Mathematics is useful for gleaning very deep connections and implications, but during the course of your undergraduate will almost never help you with your physics courses. On the other hand, CS is a tool you can whip out all the time, and these days even theorists in Physics require the use of CS (except for the really old school analytical theorists but I'm too dumb for that so I ignored that option!) Instead of analysis, I would recommend an Introduction to Topology class though. I did not take that during undergrad and really regret it now. If I had to rank upper division CS classes by order of usefulness to future research (ignoring 2800) from most useful to least would be Numerical Analysis, Machine Learning, Foundations of Data Science, Operating Systems, Algorithms, Functional Programming. 

Also, perhaps do not do what I did and satisfy requirements for the sake of requirements. Just focus on the physics and pick up things that will be useful. You also have plenty of time, still, 5 semesters is a lot of time to fit classes and stuff in.

20358,"Professor Gries has this posted in the syllabus for 2110 specifically, but imo the general gist is applicable for most classes:

&gt; Grades on the assignments are usually high ---averaging over 95. This is because everyone has the chance to talk to the course staff (instructors, TAs, consultants) and get help with understanding, programming, and debugging. For some assignments, we give a full suite of test cases, so there is little reason for not getting full credit. Thus, the submitted program may be okay --but is it entirely the result of a student's effort?

&gt; The assignments are the best tool for learning about programming and the material in the course, but they are not a good tool for determining grades.

&gt; ...

&gt; There are two points to consider. First, you can get a lot of help on the assignments ---talking to instructors, TAs, and consultants. You can get help on understanding the assignment, on understanding Java constructs and how to develop the program, on testing, on debugging, etc. The assignment turns out to be a great learning experience. But is it a good vehicle to test your programming ability? Probably not, if you get a lot of help. Thus, we see the assignments as helping mainly with learning. And for that purpose, we often grade less harshly while providing good feedback, so that you learn from our feedback.

&gt; The second point is that proficiency on the assignments, especially the ability to work at this level individually without a lot of help, prepares you extremely well for the exams, which have some programming questions and puzzles that relate to computational ways of thinking, object-oriented computing, and data structures. So the hard work done on homework will pay off on higher exam grades. A student who never really masters the material may get enough help to do well on the homeworks but will probably not do as well on the exams. Thus your exam scores shape the letter grades more than the homework does, but the homework still plays a vital role.",0.4926,0.4301,0.0773

Assuming hard curves still exist in both of those classes, it sounds like you’ll survive in Chem with minor effort but may need to cover more ground in Math 1910 to put up a decent final. I’d go 80% math / 20% chem if I was in your place, other commitments aside. 

But as previously answered, professors are much more receptive during the lecture weeks than the final weeks to providing aid and accommodations. You’d be surprised how much they will give to help you succeed...and there’s no shame in that.

All you have to do is remember that you'll be okay regardless of whatever path you decide to take.

The homeworks were also far more tedious than interesting/helpful. Though that was likely just a function of the professor.

Homeworks in some undergrad classes are also just tedious and grades on them are more reliant on how many points the TA is willing to give you...

20535,"This really reminded me of me when I was in your shoes, I, like you also struggled a lot in 2800 when I took it. Regardless of the grade you end up getting in 2800 in order to get into the cs major you need an average of a 2.5 gpa between 2800 and 2110 and 2.5 and a gpa of 2.5 between (Some math class you have to take in order to get into the cs major differs depending on the college you're in)  and 2800. If you don't meet those requirements after this semester but still want to become a cs major then, I would suggest retaking 2800 next semester and hopefully do better the second time to meet the standards. The best advice I can give as someone who was once in your shoes before is just do the best you can. If you really want to become a cs major, don't let bad grades in cs classes discourage you. Don't be afraid to try again. Everything will be okay. I promise. It might be a long and hard road but you will be fine regardless of whatever path you decide to take.",0.5586,0.3878,0.0536

20556,"&gt;Can the technical electives AND the external specialization all be physics classes?

Yes! But you need 6 classes total, and I think must be an inside concentrator for physics (this last bit may have changed though).

CS 4850 is the only one, to my knowledge. 

&gt; And would you still recommend doing CS and physics if I were to not take any of those ""core"" math classes (I'd still take the math Phys sequence)

If you're set on doing a double major, then yes. If you really are just focused on physics, then just take the CS classes that are relevant to you (you can skip e.g. 3110, 3410, 4410, etc. this way).
