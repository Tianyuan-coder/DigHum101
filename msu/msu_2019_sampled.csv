Just Google MSU CSE overrides.

I think that first month I was pretty lost but once you get used to it you'll be fine. Use Google Maps and don't be afraid to ask for directions. Most people will have no problem giving you directions, and once your in buildings looking for room numbers you'll end up finding signs everywhere usually. Give it some time. Best advice is do a dry run before classes start. Try to find your classes with Google Maps, then try it without. Once you have a general idea of where things are map out the path you want to take. Depending on where your classes are and how much time you have between them your path might change. My path changed a lot depending on weather and events going on around campus.

123,"I also am in a sorority at state and lived in but I don’t agree with this at all honestly. Maybe my organization was run differently than yours but next to none of this is accurate for my experience. Living in the sorority house was WAY cheaper than the dorms or an apartment/house and I absolutely loved it. (Plus I never had to worry about making my own food or buying groceries lol). My member class had little to no drama while living in and obviously this isn’t True for everyone but I think it’s safe to say you become friends with almost all the people in your member class so there isn’t much reason to fight or have drama for a lot of people. As for housing contracts I remember during recruitment being told which houses have a live in requirement but most of the time enough people want to live in that if you don’t want to live in you don’t have to. I signed my housing contract for the house around the same time that everyone was signing for apartments and houses so it’s not at all pushed or forced on you right after you join. I’ve had several girls in my chapter switch schools, drop for financial reasons, mental health reasons etc and I’m still in contact and friends with all of them. I’ve made the best friends I could ever ask for and had the absolute most amazing experiences. Being in a sorority has brought me out of my shell, made me feel confident, and given me leadership opportunities that have helped me grow so much. Again, not everyone has the same experience and these things vary from chapter to chapter but it’s been incredibly worthwhile for me.

I didn’t want to, but the less I partied to focus on classes, the less I felt welcome or even wanted to live in and the more ignored I was by everyone despite me trying to maintain friendships. At that point, taking out a loan meant I was paying for less privacy, more drama, debt after college, all for just the **chance of TRYING to make close friends which clearly wasn’t working. I had an awesome experience for awhile and made some good friends, but it didn’t last as long as I had hoped and I don’t think it ended up being right for me. As sucky as that is.

Michigan lost its three best defenders. They have no depth on their D line. They have a new offensive coordinator so they’ll be learning a new system. Their QB looks good not great. They’ll be relying on a freshman rb. Harbaugh has never beaten Dantonio at the big house.

MSU has the best d line in the country. The best linebacker in the B1G, and arguably the best secondary. The offense was garbage last year but the QB and entire wr core were hurt. Also warner is finally out so the playcalling will be better by default.

This note is compared with all answers given by the student involving conduct so, if something doesn't match up, that can be easily flagged in a database. I've heard of an admission to medical school revoked AFTER the person had already been in for a year or two because they lied on the conduct portion of their application.

291,"&gt;None of the “leases” for the house are leases- it’s a CONTRACT. It doesn’t follow the rules and laws of a lease. You can’t break it, no matter how hard, or for how long, you try. 

This is a misunderstanding important enough to clarify for any current or future students. 

All leases are contracts. And all leases are subject to the same laws. You can break any lease. But there will be consequences (unless the law allows you to break the lease), and the consequences depend on what the lease says. 

MSU housing, for example, will sometimes let students out of leases without requiring any payment. OP, it sounds like your lease didn't have such generous termination options. You could still have broken your lease by moving out and not paying rent, but if you did, the landlord (the sorority, I imagine) could have sued you for the rent you agreed to pay. That's the same with all leases: they are legally binding agreements between a landlord and tenant, meaning either party can take the other to court over it.

That's why it's so important to **read your lease to understand what you are agreeing to**.

If anyone reading this has questions about lease provisions or issues that come up, [MSU Law's Housing Clinic](https://www.law.msu.edu/clinics/housing.html) will likely be able to answer your question or point you in the direction of someone who can help.

I think what OP is trying to say though, is that when shit hits the fan, are people willing the put aside the goals of the house to help you. And it’s easy to just say “of course they would” until it happens. And everyone is different so it’s not concrete that they wouldn’t help you.

The other issue I have especially with girls rush is that the house chooses you and not the other way around. It’s the house choosing which girl belongs and will fit in rather than the girl being like these are the nicest girls. You sorta get what I mean? Almost like if you want to be in a sorority, you have to fit in with this set of girls. I know a lot of girls who’ve been like “X” girls are the nicest group of people but end up in “Y” house. Leaving a lot of girls upset and questioning why they weren’t good enough. Cause most people do care about the fucked up rankings.

I get what you’re saying though, a sorority/frat do have a lot of pros, you make a lot of acquaintances instantly and even make a really good friend group with some. But you can’t dismiss the cons and it’s naive to say that there aren’t any, not saying that you are. At the end of the day though, it’s all about what makes you happy and gives you enjoyment. We all seek different things in life. I’ll never be a believer that you need Greek to have fun, or you have to be in a house to be “popular” or fit in, but some might. Some people believe that being in a house gives you that college experience. But there’s no right or wrong answer as there isn’t an answer key to life.

Ultimately, vet schools don’t really care what your major was. Just that you have the prerequisites and did well in them. It’s much more about your GPA, animal/veterinary experience, and GRE than your specific major, so I’d go with whatever you’re interested in most. I had friends from various schools who majored in theatre, microbiology, neuroscience etc... it really doesn’t matter! 

Outside of class I did a couple internships at small animal clinics, worked in MSUs Animal Behavior and Welfare lab for a year, was heavily involved with MSU’s Animal Science Undergraduate Student Research Association, and worked a couple summers in MSU’s Aquatic Animal Health Lab. I think all of those experiences had much more to do with me getting in than my major. 

Personally, I started out Animal Science and found that farm animals were cool but not really the direction I wanted to go, so I added Fisheries and Wildlife halfway through undergrad and totally fell in love with that major! Awesome field trips, smaller classes, and more interesting material (in my opinion).

CSE 480 with Nahum was good, but a decent amount of work. Basically, my point is, at the 400's, I don't think it's so much the content that makes the class hard as the professor.

They just tell you all these highly improbable things like 

“find an internship after freshman year” (yeah good luck getting an internship with zero classes taken in your to-be career path)

Stuff like that, except I’m not articulating it well. They say a lot of things that make it seem like if you don’t do exactly as they say, you’re gonna be a failure in life and not graduate college.

Also stuff like telling parents at parent orientation not to let their kids come home until later in the year. Like, if my parents miss me or I miss them, I’m going home, let me do what I want to do.

I guess what I’m trying to say is that they often portray college as this all-or-nothing place where there’s strict procedure you have to follow if you want to succeed. When you’re a freshman and you’re already scared to go to this giant school far from home, the last thing you need is MSU saying stuff like that.

If you do the whole don’t answer your door thing and it becomes an on going issues, you’ll still be contacted by what’s called the ACD/CD (basically the RAs boss or bosses boss). These people have a lot more control over what happens when it comes to conduct. Although rare, people have been kicked out of university housing because of on going behavior that’s disrupting the community. I would caution against doing that all the time, but it can be done— even if police are at your door (which I saw a lot of people do for weed since you can’t tell where it’s coming from, probably a safer bet to be honest because of this).

All that being said, drinking or smoking in the dorm is actually really easy to get away with. From what i noticed being an RA it was people not being aware how loud they were being that got the RAs or even sometimes police at their door. So as long as your quiet you really shouldn’t run into too many issues and just use common sense. If you plan on drinking, maybe only pregame in your room and go to a party rather than hosting a rager in the dorms. It rarely ends well!

His mock exams are VERY similar to the actual exams, but make sure that you understand the process of each problem.  Sometimes he might throw in a hard 15 point problem that wasn’t on the mock exam, but the students who understood the material front to back were able to solve it.  Also LB exams are all free response and very conceptual, showing your work is crucial.

He also has a lot of “exam worthy” clicker questions throughout lecture and I recommend writing down the correct answer to each question (he posts the lectures online but NOT the answers).  That way, you can practice the problems before an exam and you’ll know if you’re answer is correct from past notes.

In my opinion, mastering chemistry was a waste of time so I chegged 90% of it.  The questions on mastering chemistry are nothing like the exam.  But, you get 10 points on each set so complete all of them.

### WHAT IS COMBO-X-CHANGE?

Combo-X-Change allows dining plan holders to use a meal access for a combo at Sparty’s, Sparty's Market, the MSU Union Food Court, QUE at Crossroads Food Court, the Eat at State ON-THE-GO Food Truck, or for takeout from the residential dining halls. On-campus dining plan holders can use no more than one Combo-X-Change per day, and six total per week, Sunday through Saturday. Off-campus dining plan holders and faculty/staff dining plans holders can use Combo-X-Change multiple times per day, seven days a week (one access is deducted for each use).

So, what comes with a combo? Options vary by location, and you can typically find signage with the yellow and green Combo-X-Change logo. At Sparty's and Sparty's Market, most items are marked with an A, B, C or BC on the shelf near the price. Combine items together to create a meal; your ""A"" item is a beverage, your ""B"" item is an entrée and your ""C"" item is a side or snack. Items that are BC are larger entrées. Sparty's Café locations at Brody, Case and Hubbard offer additional made-to-order options (e.g., hot breakfast, mozzarella sticks, black bean burgers). Sparty's Market has daily rotating specials, a pub menu, chopped salads, personal pizzas and grinders that are eligible as well.

Food Court locations have on site signage listing options. For example, at QUE within Crossroads Food Court, all entrées are BC items and any eligible beverage or a side can be chosen for the A item.

At ON-THE-GO Food Truck, grab any entrée plus a beverage. The Food Truck operates, weather permitting, from March through November.

Riverwalk Market at Owen has an adjoining Sparty’s with items marked A, B, C or BC as well as hot food entrée options served from the grill.

Lastly, if you’d like takeout from a residential dining hall, let the entrance host know before they scan your ID. You’ll get a takeout container, silverware, and a hot or cold beverage cup. If you visit more than one venue, to ensure compliance with foodservice regulations, items will be put on a plate for you to transfer to the container. Self-serve items such as a salad and dessert can be added too as long as the container can close.",0.1117,0.8318,0.0565
1565,"Very. Campus is big, open and well lit. While it is warm people will be walking around till like 11 on weeknights and later on weekends.

East Lansing is pretty safe, and will be busy most of the time. West of the highway (in Lansing) feels much less safe, but you will likely never be walking there.

There will definitely be people out and about, but you'll learn which routes are more well trafficked, you'll probably feel more comfortable in those areas. Also pay attention to where the green light emergency stations are on your route in case there is any trouble. 



I also believe MSU has a program where you can sign up to have someone walk you home at night. I'm sure someone else knows more about it.


Overall, I never felt unsafe walking on MSU's campus, no matter the time of night. Walking through East Lansing can be a bit more sketchy, I'd usually try to get to Grand River first before making my way home.


In the snow my best advice is don't be one of those people going wild on their bike through the snow and ice covered sidewalks. Take advantage of the bus for classes that you need it, but they can get super packed in the winter. If you can brave the cold, bundle up, put on some music, and enjoy the frigid exercise. I just graduated in May, and I already miss walking around MSU's campus. It's good exercise, there's lots to see. The winter can be miserable, but sometimes the bus just isn't worth it, and there will be times that it will completely screw you by passing your stop by since it's full. Wake up a bit earlier in the winter if you're going to take the bus to account for the fact that you may end up having to walk.

Besides a cabled connection, if you MUST have wireless printing I recommend this:

Best bet in my opinion would be to get a router, register the routers MAC address on dhcp.msu.edu, and then hook up your printer to that router via an Ethernet cable. Then just use the WiFi from your router to print wirelessly.

You can spend as little as $25 bucks to get a router on amazon but I would recommend getting something slightly more robust. Something like the NETGEAR N600.

I realize that if you end up spending money on the router that kind of defeats the purpose of saving money to print. I always liked having my own mini network and hopefully this gives you some options to think about!",0.2507,0.4966,0.2527

1891,"Hi, first thing I’d like to point out is it’s not too late to switch sections! 

I haven’t had any of these professors except J. Morgan,  but I’ve previously taken MTH 234, EGR 100, and PHY 184. Here is my breakdown:

MTH 234: I took this after calculus AB and BC, so I never had calc 2 here, just like you. This class is not too hard to pass, but hard to get a solid 4.0 in, assuming you have a decent work ethic. Pay attention in class, it’s super boring but the key to success. Study ahead of time for weekly quizzes to stay on track. You need to ace almost ALL of them to 4.0 without doing crazy good on the exams. If you can, get Maccombs, or go to his lectures. I didn’t have him but I’ve heard great things from multiple people. This class can be difficult and time consuming, so do your work early and often. Find or make a couple friends in the class to do WebWork and study with. Much better with a group.

EGR 100: The joke class of engineering. If you’ve had any physics or math classes in your entire life you have an A. Ok well do the homework and projects and it’s an A. Make sure you get decent group partners or you’ll regret it. And GO TO LECTURES. Everyone says you can skip, but the in lecture assignments go towards your grade twice! Once when they’re graded, and again when go towards like 40% of your grade in a portfolio. Just GO TO THE LECTURES and you’ll 4.0. For the final exam, spend 30-60 minutes total studying a quizlet online. It’s that easy.

PHY 184: I had this in person so your experience may vary. Please get this in person!!! The lectures give you points just for showing up. I needed a very low grade on the final to 4.0 because I did my homework and aced the quizzes. Some people didn’t do as hot on the quizzes and needed better scores. Each quiz lets you make a formula sheet. Fill it with formulas! Conceptually much easier than AP Physics Mech and E and M.

General Advice: Go to class. Go to class. GO TO CLASS. This is the most important part and I can’t stress it enough. Just showing up puts you ahead of 20% of the people. After that do your best to focus and take decent notes. Sit in the front when you can, I promise it’ll help with focusing in class. Take the time to meet a couple people in each class to share notes and study with.",0.5234,0.3703,0.1063

CSE 331 is probably the most important class because all of the job interviewers ask questions from this class.  Onsay requires everyone to purchase Zybooks.  It's worth it.

1971,"I took calc 3, three times. I transfered to MSU. I got 4.0 in both calc 1 and calc 2. I took a gap year between transferring. I could not keep up with the pace calc 3 was taught in, for the life of me. The first time, I had to drop it because the professor said he thought I was going to fail &amp; honestly I agreed with him. The 2nd time, I did fail. The 3rd I was finally able to pass but it was still a struggle. The 3rd time I took Ryan McCombs, and I wish I'd just signed up with him from the start. He is by far the best. Also, I'm by no means a slacker, and I work and study really hard. I've taken a lot of really hard classes. Calc 3 was the only class I failed at MSU &amp; I think it's the hardest class I've ever taken, not necessarily because of the material but the sheer amount of memorization and recall of old stuff that is not taught in class. It definitely felt like a weeder class. I recall really stupid questions on the exams, that required you to go back and remember old technical shit memorized from cal 1 and 2, which is what really screwed me over. Multiple choice questions messed me up too.If you get too many wrong it really hurts your grade. 

The challenge questions also felt unfair and dumb, because they seemed like literally nothing you could study for. Challenge questions were not a thing the first two times I took it. And then they added it the 3rd time. Literally no one answered the challenge questions correctly. I got the challenge question correct and I had no idea how, because I guessed. I asked the TA. He said my answer was still wrong, but he could see how it could sort of make sense. He said they gave people points for that if it made any vague sort of sense or was remotely close because hardly anyone knew how to answer it &amp; everyone was far off in their answers. They basically gave pity points....

I hated calc 3. It was ridiculously hard for no reason when I took it. 

I took Physics with Naggy online, and it was honestly kinda boring. I would have prefered to have the class in person. Physics was not too bad.

1979,"I did not take 335 with Owen so I can't quite compare it to that. However, I did take 477 with Owen.

Boddetti's class is not nearly as heavy on the programming as what Owen classes are. The programming projects were kind of hard to start of, if you didn't really understand the underlying concepts, algorithms and mathematical equations. However, once you got the hang of that, they honestly were not too horrible and could be finished in a very reasonable amount of time.

The thing with Owen is that he explains things in detail very very well, and it's in writing and video, so if you miss something you can go back and easily review it.

Boddetti explains things pretty well too, but I find the material easy to forget because it's literally high level math, which I personally tend to struggle with. Looking back at the notes was more confusing because it was just a lot of equations. I'd record the lectures on my phone for it.

He has homework assignments which are more of a written thing, and then you just submit your final answer on an online form.

His homework and project grades were weighted by how well you did. So your highest programming project grade, and homework grade were worth the most.

The exams were kinda rough. He had a Midterm Exam and a Final. Our class average on our Midterm was around a 50%. I don't recall what the average was for the final but with his curve, I'm willing to bet it was on the lower end too. Probably also around the mid 50s or 60.

You definitely want to start studying for his exams soon because he covers a lot of material.

For our Midterm he did not allow a cheat sheet, for our final he did.

I recall one of TA's for the course even said they were a bit harder and that he even struggled to write the project. 

I don't know how many of the TA's onsay had graduated, but I felt like all of her teaching assistants last year were by far some of the best I've had for any class.

I'd say the biggest thing you can do to help yourself, is start the projects early. Like really really early, and ask questions really really early on, because as the week progresses the help room fills, piazza gets flooded, and it gets harder and harder to get help if you needed. 

Also, if you don't already know some people in the class, I'd work on making friends in it. Having friends to discuss projects with helped a lot.",0.5891,0.3441,0.0668

The course is super math heavy, so if you're not strong in math, prepare to struggle quite a bit. 

I think the course was taught on par with something they'd teach at MIT. There is an MIT class youtube channel which is extremely similar to what he taught, like to a tee. 

If you're just taking the class because you think ""AI"" is the hot thing to learn and know for the sake of money, I wouldn't take this. You're going to hate it. 

If you're absolutely passionate about the subject, and it fascinates you and you're willing to put in a lot of effort, study time, and make visits to office hours with the professor and the TA, then I think it's totally worth it. Bodetti, is really nice both in the classroom and during office hours. I went to his office hours quite a bit which helped. 

I wasn't a big fan of the TA, although I didn't hate him either. He could be both really nice and really rude. If you bother him enough, he's totally nice &amp; willing to help lol. I asked a lot of stupid questions over and over, because I was struggling. He struck me as the type, who expects you to know way more than you might &amp; gets annoyed with ""stupid"" questions. 

Boddeti on the other hand, never seemed annoyed with any questions I had, regardless of how dumb they were, or if he'd already explained it. He'd totally try to explain it again and give multiple examples.

Neighborhood streets are great for free parking, but fill up quickly, but aren’t too bad of a trek. Usually just need to check the signs. Rules aren’t too strict except late night where unless you call and let the city know you are there, they can tow you. 

Campus parking is specific lots depending on what lots you’re able to purchase. You can do “pay-by-plate” depending on how long you’re on campus and what days you want to drive but this can be expensive if you drive everyday and are on campus a while. I forget exact hourly price. For the lots, it depends which one. Again, if you are early enough or leave late enough at night, Kellogg center ramp, and other ramps you can park on free as long as you leave after the attendants leave or after 6pm (for the ramps that arent Kellogg) but for those your need to be there before the opening and closing gate requires ID to scan.

My favorite part of Comp Sci is that I get to solve problems, similar to engineering or math, but I don't have to do math on a regular basis and instead I get to program. A good test to see how much you like programming is CSE 231. In my experience, if you don't like 231 then the major isn't a good fit for you. If you do plan to stay on as Comp Sci, I recommend getting an internship this summer, if it works for you.

Don’t do all those drugs, they heavily fuck with how your brain produces serotonin for a while after you do them and if you do them you’re basically gonna be out of serotonin for like a week, and lack of serotonin is one of the primary indicators for depression. If you’re still on any SSRI antidepressants I seriously ask you to please not do MDMA or MDA because doing either of them on an SSRI can be potentially fatal and it’s not gonna feel good either.

What you need to know:

·   Scooters may only be operated in bicycle lanes and streets. Scooters are not permitted on sidewalks.

·   Scooters will be available in areas designated as mobility hubs. When done riding, scooters must be returned to a mobility hub.

·   Scooters will be phased onto campus as mobility hubs are established. MSUPD is working to create these areas without eliminating current vehicle parking spots.""

They've both long since graduated from Michigan State: one owns his own business now, the other is in his last year of medical school. Both were MSU students, but I didn't meet either through class, clubs or parties. I've traveled plenty and have friends from all across the world, but never managed to make any good ones at State. 

I know for a fact some others are in the same boat. That doesn't mean you are, or that you won't be. I think the best advice anyone can give, no matter what kind of person you are, is just to put yourself out there. Take a few steps from your comfort zone: join a club, go to parties, get a part-time job and take a vacation in Latin America or Europe for Spring Break. In all probability, you'll eventually find a nice, whether it's on-campus or off. 

I think there's a very unfortunate misconception that university must necessarily be the time when you make the most friends and have the most fun. For some people, that's the case. But it shouldn't be. 

Get out there, figure out what you like, and spend time with people who are worth yours. It'll come or it won't, but you can increase the probability of finding a circle by taking measured social risks and exploring interests, new and established.

Landon’s hallways are dark and grey, which aren’t the most exciting, while Mayo’s are bright and cheery. Mayo is just as fresh and new on the inside as Landon though, including the community bathrooms. The other West Circle dorms, while beautiful on the outside, are nasty and old on the inside. I’d never choose them.

TLDR; Landon and Mayo are pretty much the same, minus different hallway colors (matter of preference) and the fact that Landon has less study and relaxation space due to the caf (also matter of preference). I personally had no problem walking 30 seconds from Mayo to Landon to eat and appreciated the increased space and quieter atmosphere that Mayo had compared to Landon.",0.5305,0.3521,0.1175

Data visualized through Microsoft Excel via comparing location and location frequency.

Data was collected through exporting transaction logs from 26 August 2018 to 3 May 2019. This is the entirety of freshmen year. Context: Michigan State University (MSU) requires students to scan their student identification card in order to enter the cafeteria. I exported these transaction logs. MSU students, please see https://eacct-msu-sp.blackboard.com/eAccounts/AnonymousHome.aspx to see your own data.

The data collected through exporting transaction logs needed to be filtered to remove unnecessary and duplicate data for easier analysis. This was accomplished through Vim with particular emphasis on the replace function.

At MSU, students have the ability to use a combo exchange which essentially is a small little snack or a small box for you to quickly get food and leave with that box. When you enter a cafeteria requesting a combo exchange, they code this data under combo exchange so isolation is possible. However, I decided to include this data into this visualization due to the fact entering the cafeteria with a combo exchange they scan it only as a combo exchange. See Table 2 for this information.

3401,"I lived in north for three years and I’d rank the buildings I lived in as Mason &gt; Williams &gt; Campbell. Mason was the smallest room I lived in but it was a single on the third floor, so that was to be expected. I had my most memorable year living there so I’m pretty biased, but the pluses are plenty of lounges and the game room in the basement if that interests you. You get the benefits of the SnyPhi caf and Spartys without having to live in the building with all the public traffic (I did gain 20 pounds that year though...thanks late night). Williams is very unique and pretty, inside and outside. There’s a lot of lounge space and the old ballroom makes for a good study area (or place to work on art projects which is mostly what I used it for). Campbell is okay, but I didn’t spend as much time in the community spaces because I wasn’t home much that year and when I was home I stayed in my room. It is the closest to the union which is nice when you’re a smaller-than-average girl walking alone to late night (not that I ever felt unsafe on campus, but it definitely made Mom feel better lol). 

If I could have lived in any of the others, I would have picked Landon since it had just been completely renovated a few years ago. Mayo is nice and pretty recently updated, plus AC in the common areas was fantastic, but it’s definitely a spooky place. I can’t comment on Yakeley/Gilchrist because I only ever used it as a cut-through to the bus stop when I lived in Williams. I did eat in the old Yakeley caf once before they closed it, a weird experience to say the least (the tray return was this creepy ass vertical conveyor that plunged into the darkness of the basement?? No bueno).

So they have no concept of how to teach, let alone how to teach material a lot of people already struggle with. 

I took it spring 2012. There were 2-3 sections of it, each full with ~650 people. IIRC the curve for my section was 83(?) for a 4.0 and a 73ish for a 3.5. The class average for most exams were in the 50s-60s. The next semester there was only one section of BS162, and that had maybe 200 people in it. That was all that survived the first semester.

3546,"It's not a pyramid scheme, but it's also not an internship. It's like buying my a temporary franchise that you run the risk of not being profitable despite working your ass off all summer and much of the school year leading up. 

I worked as a regular painter for student painters one summer and my first boss had to be bought out of her business and was left without a job month into summer. She also had to spend most weekends during the spring going to training and trying to line up customers for the summer.

My second boss was one of the managers that actually made a profit of over 10k but she worked everyday weekends included well over 8 hours a day so in the end probably less than minimum wage.

I can say though being a painter was not bad for me personally and beat working at a grocery store like I had in the past. They actually have to pay you for the time you work unlike the interns and I enjoyed being outside. 

Im not sure I'd recommend it though. It's risky because if your manager sucks they could go out of business before summer is over and then you're out of luck. And the companies are pretty predatory in the way the present it to young students as this great opportunity that's actually not a guaranteed thing, so you probably don't want to associate with them

3664,"This is an issue where you get vilified by virtue signalers over, communities shouldn’t ever abuse the homeless... but on the otherhand they also shouldn’t be too welcoming as to cause them to migrate into the area from surrounding areas.


There’s a middleground between going through measures like putting up dividers on benches to prevent them sleeping there or other deterrents that are clearly offensive tactics,


as opposed to the more moderate ground of merely failing to hand them money or accommodate their other types of nonmedical requests for assistance,


to the other extreme of actually encouraging them to come to where you are because your treatment is far more favorable than other surrounding areas (small radius) because you hand out a lot of food or money or even provide shelter for them.


Most of us are not in a position to give and most of us aren’t completely devoid of empathy, so we should try to aim more for the middle ground. Do not reinforce begging behavior in this area by rewarding it, but at the same time do not be cruel to them since they are people living in a precarious situation that you probably would want no part of living.


This is the type of subject where people are just waiting to execute you for in “The Court of Public Opinion” for your honesty, “how can you be so cruel”, the truth is everyone wants to come off like they care but no one actually wants to deal with the issue itself.


I had a homeless man offer me some of his little food he had outside a bar to me once maybe 2-3 years ago (Lansing Eastside), he wanted me to take from him as an equal. He wanted me to not look down upon him, he wanted a simple gesture of friendship (even if the notion seems superficial to us). I saw through this display yet I could not take this guy’s bag of chips, I knew I could not reciprocate and return the favor later without reinforcing his presence behind an establishment that did not want him but pretended to have compassion for him. It would hurt their business to have him and vilify them to tell him to fuck off repeatedly.


We as a country need to do more to help people like this, but you must understand that handing them money is not a solution, we need far more involved means than what the average college student can provide these people. And keep in mind if you do too much, you do magnify the issues with having them in the area. It’s dark and twisted, but what can you honestly do that actually helps? You can’t cure a systemic failure with a few 1’s or 5’s out of your already bloodied wallet.

If I have food, I'll sometimes share it with them. Occasionally I'll stick around for a brief conversation, too.

But no matter where you are in the world, it's rarely a good idea to give money to pan-handlers. In the United States, most chronically homeless people suffer from mental illness, addiction or some combination of the two. Unless you're working with a reputable organization or have an established relationship with the recipient, there's no way to gauge how responsibly whatever money you give is going to be spent. It could be used for a blanket, for alcohol, for cigarettes or bus fare--and if you don't know, it's best not to act as an enabler.

IMO, the best way to respond is to keep your money in your pockets. If you feel bad and want to make a difference, share some food, volunteer or donate however much you'd have given to a worthwhile, reputable and local NGO.",0.0912,0.4194,0.4894

I had Prof. Walker when I took CEM 251 a few years back. There's other stuff in the class as well, like analyzing NMR spectra, and not everything requires thinking about acid/bases. It sounds like a really tough situation, but remember you still have a few weeks to decide whether or not you can do it. You're just 3 lectures in man, I think you should study up a little bit on acids and bases and see where you are in another week or so. 

Classifying things as acids and bases is really just saying ""this molecule is pretty stable without this proton"", or saying ""this molecule can bond to another hydrogen and be stable"". The math is all thinking about where the equilibrium between acids and bases is going to be, or saying what the energy difference is when the particular molecule gains or loses a proton. Obviously the particulars of any problem are going to be a lot more complicated, but overall acid/base chemistry in Orgo is just thinking about the whether molecules ""like"" gaining or losing protons and what that means for how those molecules react.",0.07,0.3963,0.5337

The least likely things a homeless person needs are food and volunteerism, as in you volunteering your time to serve food. At one homeless shelter (not EL), we could serve ourselves breakfast at 6 am if there were no volunteers.

MSU is a very good school, and a 3.2 gpa shows that you can’t handle and excel at their curriculum—which is really the only purpose of being there. To stay safe, get involved in much more ec’s, challenge yourself senior year!!! More AP’s show them you’ve progressed not regressed. Many kids apply to MSU, and don’t think they don’t have 1400+, if the admissions committee thinks you won’t do well in the school the slightest bit, they won’t accept even if you got a 1600.

In general for tailgating, yes, only one person needs a truck or a car and they invite their friends to their spot. however you don't even really need a vehicle. If you go walk around the tailgating now, you will see the people basically just need a tent and some food to be happy. Until you make more friends you should consider joining a club.

One of the incidents cited in the article is a Reddit post; the other is a bomb threat, which, so far as any of us are aware, did not threaten Stanley directly. I don't think it's fair to conflate freshman idiocy with claims of an impending massacre. 

On the Banks did, indirectly, touch on a more important issue: that such claims, serious or not, are symptomatic of widespread anger with the administration. Instead of talking about the efficacy of varied forms of protest, it may be worthwhile to explore the reasons why students and members of the community might act out. Do we have faith that Stanley and the trustees are carrying out reform that's in the best interests of the school, of Nassar's victims or our academic programs? Has the administration, in the past several years, been transparent in its communications? Has whatever recent change we've experienced altered perceptions or fostered trust in any meaningful way? 

Honestly, I don't like the title of this article or the way it's framed. President Stanley is not being repeatedly, consistently or regularly threatened. The bomb threat may have been tied to the Board of Trustees' meeting, the $4.5 million fine or something entirely unrelated. We can speculate about motive, fairly or not, but I don't see the use in penning an opinion piece which creates a problem where none exists--when the real problem is not terroristic claims or pranks gone awry, or staffers who were forced to evacuate a building, but the desiccation of trust between Michigan State's institutions and its student body. 

It's True that violence or threats thereof won't fix any of that. But there hasn't been any physical violence, and there haven't been many threats. Yet the problem remains; it's not inconceivable that irrationality might beget irrationality.",0.0169,0.2791,0.7039

We should be upholding our University's image by not using profanity and whatnot especially when so many are looking at MSU as the ""little brother"" to UM. Like it or not, we constantly have to prove ourselves here at MSU especially after recent news events. Swearing/making a scene is something the younger/more immature would do for attention so I think it's important to stay classy for our school's reputation. I've also heard from my roommate in the band that in the winter, people in the student section take to making snowballs from the snow on the top tiers of the stadium and just throwing it down into the student section, often hitting band performers (and of course most of them really don't appreciate that lol).

That being said, however, I've grown up in the Joe Louis watching hockey games since I was very young and there are profanity chants too. The Bullshit chant is one that occurs practically every game and brings back memories (and of course it's a chant used across other sports too). Besides the chants, drunk people yell and scream and swear at the game constantly while spilling their beer on the people in front of them. So many games I've had a family sitting in front of me and a drunk group of people behind me slurring cuss words and the parents shooting them dirty looks. I feel so horrible even though I'm not the one doing it. Despite being around all that even when I was a TODDLER at the wings games, I still grew up fine. I sure do cuss like a sailor but I know where and when it's appropriate. Parents will want to shield their kids ears but honestly most will grow up fine even after hearing some drunk idiots swear in public. 

This stuff will keep happening in sports, it's just the reality of it. Both sides of the argument make equally valid points.

They might seem fun when you are at a party on Albert St at 11p after a long game day in EL, but in this context the chants sounds like something an entitled Walmart Wolverine would use during a game.

That said, I don't think you can compare the two student sections. You have to apply to be in the Izzone, which is also much smaller. I don't think Dantonio asking the students not to swear so much would actually work. Hell, I don't think it would work if Dantonio, Izzo, Mateen Cleaves, and Kirk Cousins all come to ask together.

4750,"Marching band member here. 

Part of the Spartan Marching Band traditions/rules is that we can't swear in uniform. And we're all fine with that, because profanity isn't always necessary.

When the student section yells ""1,2,3, first down B*tch!"" After we play C in the fight song (what most people know as ""See their team is weakening""), we say ""state"" instead of ""b*tch"". It got so bad that the school actually said ""Can you change what you play so the student section doesn't continue shouting those profanities?"" So that's why we didn't play that song ever during the first game this year, and we know the student section wasn't happy. But that didn't stop them, they still found times to shout it out. (During the second game, one of our directors forgot and called for the song to be played and that's why we were going back and forth between songs that day.)

If you read further in that article along in the article, you will find a witness story of how the student section yelled ""F*ck you!"" Right as a man and his daughters (who were dressed in Tulsa apparel) walked in front of the section as well as when an injured Western player was lying on the field. It doesn't matter if it was truly aimed at those three or aimed at the injured football player or not, that right there is just sad and unnecessary. 

I'm all for having a great time and all that, but I don't think we need to shout profanities so loud that they are audible outside the stadium. Kids come to these games, and I don't want little 7 year old Charlie to start dropping the f-bomb because he went to a Michigan State football game.

First off you have to follow rules of the road so you'll basically be following with traffic during class changes which takes forever to get through.

Secondly and most importantly mopeds I personally don't consider roadworthy. They are too slow, speed governed to 25-maybe 35 mph, they are small and hard to see, AND their acceleration is virtually no existant!

Also just like a motorcycle you don't have much control in show and ice. You weigh very little compared to any car this you'll be subject to the laws of physics that much more easily.

Although it’s hard to see now, I can promise you that you’ll get your chance to go to parties and stuff. The beginning of freshman year it’s nearly impossible to get into parties, especially if you’re a guy, because you just don’t have those connections yet. It can happen. Hell, you can throw those parties of your own in the near future. For now if you can, I’d focus your attention on other stuff. Clubs, making friends in class, exploring your options, that stuff. The more social connections you make, the better.

It may be True that another school would be a better fit for you, but this is honestly a common experience for people. At any college, I think. It’s a lonely and frustrating time. The grass isn’t necessarily greener on the other side.

I’d also like to add that I’m a huge introvert with social anxiety, and I’ve found good people here. I haven’t had the perfect “college experience” but I don’t think that honestly exists outside of movies.

the bigger issue is how we actually played. the offense did msu offense things and our ""elite"" defense evaporated when we needed them the most on that last drive. gotta give props to lewerke and the rest of the offense to get us down field in the last minute but other than that it was just a stereotypical msu football game. i drank to forget last night",0.0103,0.0794,0.9102

5301,"Hey not an MSU student/alum (actually went to ""The Other School"") but I studied economics and now work in an analytics/forecasting role for one of the largest analytics/info services companies in the world.

If I can give you some advice, it is take as many stats classes as you can. Also take Econometrics once your math background can support the material. From my experience, it's a pretty challenging course, but you will really reap the benefit.

Also, if you're interested in government work, I would take a Labor Economics class if offered. I never did, but it would be the first one I would sign up for if/when I go back for continuing education. Any monetary econ courses would help as well, but I'm biased there because most of my upper levels were monetary-related.

If there are niche courses offered (for example I had the opportunity to take courses on non-traditional economic formats and also a course on behavioral economics – neither of which I took) then try to fit them I to your schedule if it allows. Remember that the field is always changing (especially from a macro perspective) and today's niche classes may be the future form that competitive markets adopt. You would really excel if you understand that material right out of college.

Also: INTERNSHIPS and/or CO-OPs. We brought on at least one college student each summer to our Consulting internship. You pretty much get to set your hours, you get paid a pretty dece hourly wage with overtime options beyond 40 hours, you get paid time off, you get to see how an office works in real life, and you get to interact with arguably the best data across the multiple fields we cover. Feel free to PM me if you want more information.

Lastly: PIVOT TABLES. I use them every single day in one way or another. Bonus points if you memorize hotkey commands for manipulating data. It will blow the mind of everyone 30+.

Good luck my friend! I wish you nothing but the best for your journey into the economic field.",0.6656,0.3079,0.0265

If you're looking for something affordable to get you across campus, the on-campus msu bike services center is a smart choice. Typically used bikes are sold there.

Update: I fixed it using science (or the scientific method). Here's what I did incase anyone else experiences the same issue.
The one file that it would let me submit was also the one with the largest file size. The other files were significantly smaller than this larger file.
I developed a hypothesis, namely:
""There exists a minimum possible file size that will be accepted"" (and the largest one must be above this minimum)
So I edited in some special effects to one of the smaller files (adding effects increases the file size), I made sure that the effects added to the quality of the photo (making it look more clear overall, rather than less) 
After doing this, it allowed me to submit the newly edited photo (which was now the new largest in terms of file size).
Thus it would seem there is a minimum file size that crowdmark will accept, somewhere around 120 kilobytes. If you have this problem, try making sure your file size is large enough, which you can do by adding a filter and messing with the photos properties.",0.3494,0.5453,0.1053

Of course, exceptions could and should be made for repeat offenders or persons who perpetrated particularly violent crimes.

It'd be easy to make a morality-based counterargument. By and large, I think it's alright to maintain registries for recently-released and recently-paroled inmates. After all, not every sex offender stays on the registry for life. Furthermore, there's a significant difference between a serial child rapist and a 17-year old who has intercourse with their 15-year old S.O. 

However, this country doesn't do a great job of rehabilitating former prisoners. Putting someone on the sex offender registry for life greatly diminishes their opportunity to find future employment.

If they seem to be leaving the floor open for you, go ahead and sell yourself. Just prep yourself and be as honest as possible. They want people at the school. Ask about probationary acceptance/ conditional acceptance if he/she say you aren’t able to get in. Worst case scenario, ask THEM what you can do to be accepted summer or next fall.

But I used to go there every day, and I just became familiar with everything not so good about it, or I would have a bad experience and rant on here. They have an amazing selection, and the seating there is awesome. There's always a spot at peak times for the most part. I  like that they have a lot of smaller tables going around the perimeter that are usually by a window. Great for people that eat alone. There's also different sections, and unique areas, not just one massive area with a bunch of tables. That really helps make a large cafeteria seem smaller. The main downside is that they don't switch up their menu that much. At sny-phi, they have a different thing every day. At Brody, it's all the same.

What I'd like to see is are survivors getting a fair amount of pay that is to say if you were assaulted 30 times over other person assaulted 3 by Nasser the one assaulted 30 times should get more money and person assaulted 3 less?

Also is the money being used for treatment or is it being used for other things. Because I'm certain some survivors aren't going after MSU for the money, but their parents may be.

Sadly I'm sure there are some that did this, it makes other survivors look bad and clearly wasn't the intent of the fund. In my opinion I feel Rachel is making some money off of this namely because of the amount of times she's asking for money and more money. We get you want compensation just that we don't understand why you need more and more. She is the most volcal which is good, just like I said it seems suspicious to keep ranting and asking for more money without any real solutions, etc. I wanna know if there's any other students that share that opinion or have any theories why some are asking for a shit ton.

Gamers, as we all know, are lone wolves, who cannot be tamed nor trusted (unless you buy me an Asiago Chicken Ranch Club at Wendy’s with a large Coke and a 4-6 pc. nugget). But as he talked about it, it made more and more sense (despite the fact that he himself was barely able to articulate words at the time, as he had just snuck out of his hospital bed the night after he had a stroke, heart attack, and was run over by 17 consecutive Honda Civics). With communism, Gamers would never have to work against society by themselves. Gamers could truly rise up, and form a complete utopia, free from oppression and minorities. We would all be privy to the same games on steam (not epic though because they’re capitalist dogs who should be shot), so no single Gamer would have a P2W advantage over another. But the best part?

Gamers wouldn’t be free from society. They would be society.

So join me gamers, in a world free from oppression, where all could—

6043,"As a Wisconsin native, I think Madison's bike-support is on another level by far from Lansing's, though admittedly I haven't biked either. 

Until this year I've lived in ACTUALLY FUCKING NOWHERE, WI and while being an avid biker in every other context, I have zero experience with biking in a city much rather actually using bike lanes. 

As such, for the time being, if I do bike around I'm probably going to use sidewalks, which I personally do not think (as someone who also often goes for walks/runs) should be a problem. The thing is if you're biking on a sidewalk, don't fucking race around and YOU need to be the one yielding being the bigger, faster, heavier thing using something not exclusively for you. If you have common sense and any awareness, you should be a non-issue.

edit: wanna note that divided or spacious, non garbage-tier bike lanes are fine and I would happily use. unfortunately, that's not most I see, though I don't actually commute to/attend MSU, just a young dude in Lansing.",0.0926,0.3198,0.5877

Young bike-riding students just aren't used to utilizing bike lines due to wherever they came from maybe? idk, we should just send anonymous surveys out to bike riders who use the sidewalk and see why they do it

i keep bringing this up but i spent my summer at UW-Madison. That city is the perfect example of being bike friendly while being fully integrated with their campus. Designated bike lines are perfectly set up and colored and on every main road, and even the cross lights have bike signals. This in turn promotes a feedback loops where drivers have a higher awareness of cyclists and are super cautious when driving. and i think it stems from being a large city with a huge population of cyclists who use the lanes. The cars and busses zoom around here at MSU with no regard to cyclists even when cyclists are using the lanes, so i cant even get fully mad at the people on the bike lanes (even though i called them a mean name in the parent comment).

it would be cool if MSU could somehow get to that point with bikes like UW, but it aint gonna happen overnight.  someone needs to start a coalition",0.4554,0.4093,0.1352

2. Northwestern, I applied and got in but it was too small of a school and I wasn’t a fan of the atmosphere there.

&gt;I’ve ended up on the windshield of a driver who wasn’t paying attention before but that’s beside the point. Note to OP, If there is not a bike lane and you are still in the street you should ride in the middle of the lane. However this doesn’t mean that you should squeeze on the right side of stoped traffic. You are a “car” and are obligated to follow all the rules of the road. Also please wear a helmet and don’t be afraid to give a couple good pounds on their car. If they cut you off make sure you get their license plate number and report the incident to campus police.

-------
Not a lot of good advice here.  Don't ride in the middle of the lane. Don't pound on a car unless you want a road rage incident or to damage a car and deal with the legal/civil repercussions that come from that.

Also, in regards to riding in the middle of a lane:

""If riding your bike below the posted speed limit, a cyclist is required to ride as close as practicable to the right hand curb or edge of the road. (MCL 257.660a) However, this statute recognizes five (5) exceptions or situations where a cyclist need not ride as close to the right hand curb or edge of the road as practicable:

When passing another bicycle or a vehicle proceeding in the same direction.

When preparing to turn left.

When conditions make the right hand edge of the roadway unsafe or unreasonably unsafe for bicycle users, including, but not limited to:

Surface hazards (i.e., ruts in the pavement or potholes);

An uneven roadway surface;

Drain openings;

Debris;

Parked or moving vehicles or bicycles;

Pedestrians;

Animals;

Other obstacles; or

The lane is too narrow to permit a vehicle to safely overtake and pass a bicycle.

When operating a bicycle in a lane in which traffic is turning right, but the cyclist intends to proceed straight through the intersection; and

When riding on a one-way highway or street that has two (2) or more lanes. In this situation, the cyclist may also ride as close to the left curb or edge of the roadway as practicable.""

------

Reporting a license plate for someone cutting you off will often have 0 effect. The incident has to be witnessed by police. A recording may or may not work, as you can't verify who was driving at the time.

If it happens in East Lansing, 'campus police' can't do anything either.

It’s an interesting psychological issue...

To take something the other person must lose that thing, so you get +x and they get -x, but they made the investment to acquire the object to begin with. 

We’re all college students and the victim is a random target that you never see (generally) so you have no notion of what the other person owns, if you could make a “Robinhood” argument then that’s one thing. People could buy losing $10 out of $1-10k is worse than $10 out of $1-100M like when you weigh your assets against the store you’re shoplifting from, yeah we can get into ethical gray areas. But stealing from a random peer (who could even be less well off than you) is not the same as stealing from Wal-Mart.

You have no idea what this person is going through on top of how much they even own, what if that was OP’s last $5-50 in their wallet before payday? (I have no idea what that cost but the concept still remains). What if OP had a vet emergency for their dog after that bike accessory purchase and couldn’t replace it for awhile due to not paying rent in time?

Just don’t steal from your peers, please.
Little things like these literally are sociopathic on the small scale, what makes you more entitled to the person’s property (that they purchased) than them?

It’s a culture of selfishness that people really need to think over.",0.0146,0.1679,0.8175

6972,"I've never rented a house from crmc per say, but my bro and I lived in an apartment last year through them and in our experience they were pretty good.

They provided free internet, heat, water, and trash. Course heat varies based on property. We also received 100% of our security deposit back. They also didn't bother us at all (only time was when they were looking to install an bathroom fan during break and it was kinda awkward).

The only issues we had were the overall quality was meh, some apartments were in rougher conditions than others plus they had noise between floors (heard footsteps, etc.). We also had a pipe burst (small leak), a light fixture died, and a window cracked due to old age and weather.

Overall they communicated in a timely manner and the maintenance people were chill. Plus they answered any questions we had promptly and fixed stuff fairly quick (first month they are backlogged).

The thing I don't like about crmc was that they prorated rent (eg $500 would be $2000 per rent period) which is somewhat understandable because most don't have experience renting prior. Also didn't like how the inventory checklist was due within 24 hours instead of the standard 7 days by Michigan law and also didn't appreciate we couldn't do final walkthrough with landlord.

 So overall I'd give them 4 out of 5 because they treated us decently and seemed to not put up with BS from other tenants (one above me destroyed two smoke detectors in my unit by having a ""washing machine"" setup improperly twice).

What I recommend besides crmc is Omni Detroit holdings LLC. They are pretty good about repairs and haven't bothered me much. I don't know much about them because they did a lease takeover from Hudgins Realty when the bought the property few weeks after signing lease.

No matter which company you decide to go with make sure you a) understand the lease in it's entirety, b) make sure you have enough to pay rent in case of loss of income, etc., c) try the hardest to not cause any damages whether that is putting holes in the wall, etc. and repair any damages you think can be blamed on you (screen torn and wasn't like that when you moved in you'd repair screen yourselves), d) take photos and videos before and after move out incase you need to go to small claims court, e) write very detailed damages on the inventory checklist, f) don't be stupid and put bottle caps down the garbage disposal, etc., g) understand a landlord wants to give your deposit back

Lastly I'd look up Michigan attorney general landlord tenant handbook. It contains a shit load of info about leases, evictions, getting your security deposit back, etc. There is also free legal resources available at asmsu if your confused or have any concerns landlord isn't dealing with.

Good luck and I'm sure you'll make a good choice.",0.1697,0.455,0.3754

7097,"I lived with crmc at 513 Hillcrest. Apparently many bandos live there as well. It's not too far from campus but it's not right by a bus stop either.

My experience with crmc the tl;Dr version is that they were decent as long as you througly document damages before move in and same moving out. Don't put any holes or modify anything unless you damage something yourself (ie window screen got broken so I repaired it myself)

From an earlier Reddit post....

I've never rented a house from crmc per say, but my bro and I lived in an apartment last year through them and in our experience they were pretty good.

They provided free internet, heat, water, and trash. Course heat varies based on property. We also received 100% of our security deposit back. They also didn't bother us at all (only time was when they were looking to install an bathroom fan during break and it was kinda awkward).

The only issues we had were the overall quality was meh, some apartments were in rougher conditions than others plus they had noise between floors (heard footsteps, etc.). We also had a pipe burst (small leak), a light fixture died, and a window cracked due to old age and weather.

Overall they communicated in a timely manner and the maintenance people were chill. Plus they answered any questions we had promptly and fixed stuff fairly quick (first month they are backlogged).

The thing I don't like about crmc was that they prorated rent (eg $500 would be $2000 per rent period) which is somewhat understandable because most don't have experience renting prior. Also didn't like how the inventory checklist was due within 24 hours instead of the standard 7 days by Michigan law and also didn't appreciate we couldn't do final walkthrough with landlord.

So overall I'd give them 4 out of 5 because they treated us decently and seemed to not put up with BS from other tenants (one above me destroyed two smoke detectors in my unit by having a ""washing machine"" setup improperly twice).

What I recommend besides crmc is Omni Detroit holdings LLC. They are pretty good about repairs and haven't bothered me much. I don't know much about them because they did a lease takeover from Hudgins Realty when the bought the property few weeks after signing lease.

No matter which company you decide to go with make sure you a) understand the lease in it's entirety, b) make sure you have enough to pay rent in case of loss of income, etc., c) try the hardest to not cause any damages whether that is putting holes in the wall, etc. and repair any damages you think can be blamed on you (screen torn and wasn't like that when you moved in you'd repair screen yourselves), d) take photos and videos before and after move out incase you need to go to small claims court, e) write very detailed damages on the inventory checklist, f) don't be stupid and put bottle caps down the garbage disposal, etc., g) understand a landlord wants to give your deposit back

Lastly I'd look up Michigan attorney general landlord tenant handbook. It contains a shit load of info about leases, evictions, getting your security deposit back, etc. There is also free legal resources available at asmsu if your confused or have any concerns landlord isn't dealing with.

Good luck and I'm sure you'll make a good choice.",0.2778,0.4307,0.2915

They aren't any better than you because they've taken these classes. In fact they are in the exact same spot as you, same school same class.

Imposter syndrome is a real thing. If you haven't heard of it look it up. People who are highly educated still feel like they are stupid or a fraud. That doesn't mean they are.

Didn’t know anyone. 

I think two things changed my trajectory and allowed me to survive and eventually thrive there. I unwittingly followed the advice “Just be yourself” by being open and obvious about what my interests were (clothes, music, sports teams, etc.). Second, I tried my best to connect with people and to be approachable. I’d offer sincere compliments on something someone was wearing or ask what they were listening to or ask about where they were from. I’d make it a point to always find someone on my floor to have lunch/dinner with - especially with people who seemed introverted like me.

Research is helpful but at the end of the day it depends on where you want to end up. I’m not saying that you need to know what you want to specialize in right now but it’s something to keep in mind. Furthermore MD schools focus on the science of medicine while DO schools focus on the human component of medicine. At the end of the day you should need to have something that sets you apart from the rest of the meds hook candidates. Having generic research for the sake of having it isn’t going to get you anywhere.

Edit: I’m not saying you won’t get in with generic research but I also know that I’m not entirely wrong. OP I truly wish you the best of luck in your meds hook journey",0.4096,0.5142,0.0762

I suppose you could wander around and try to just get into frat parties but this is harder. Maybe bring some ladies with you, and the frats will want you in more. If you don't have many lady friends maybe try to find some on tindr.

Also, VERY important, fraternities LOATHE cargo shorts. They aren't fashionable enough or something. Indicates you're a dork freshman who probably just started drinking. Do not wear cargo shorts.

7459,"I have said it multiple times but the biggest thing you NEED to start doing in calc 2 if you haven't for other math classes is dig deep into why you are doing what you're doing. Yeah yeah easier said than done but seriously, you've gotta start trying. You have to know the reasoning behind your integral set-ups, what makes certain functions work better with different techniques, etc. Look for the patterns, classify the examples by what worked and try to keep that in mind going forward. You will not thrive in calc 2 if you try to memorize everything. Imo it's the first math class where that holds True and that's why it trips people up so bad. 

When you go to MLCs or office hours, try to just talk through problems with someone to have them help you put what's happening into words. Then write it down. Do extra practice. You can start doing it now, or you can not and start doing it in spring when you retake it... Might feel like it's too late rn but it's not.

Sometimes our directors just forget and call for us to play the original one (usually because it was an amazing play or it was because the student section has already united to continue the chant despite our efforts).

I, for one, would rather spend my summers just about anywhere other than East Lansing. The last time I had an apartment, I got out of my lease as soon as the academic year ended, then I flew to Mexico\*. I had more fun living on half of what I'd have spent in Michigan. 

But that, too, comes back to circumstances. I work online. Not everyone works online.

If you haven't already, I would recommend making an appointment with the mental health professionals at Olin (it's free). Your post appears to be less about leases and more about the toll domestic abuse has taken on you, psychologically and socially.

From there, I'd compare it with MSU's [public policy program](https://reg.msu.edu/AcademicPrograms/ProgramDetail.aspx?Program=7698) and the economics program (you would have to choose between the [bachelor of arts](https://reg.msu.edu/AcademicPrograms/ProgramDetail.aspx?Program=4728), which gives you much more freedom and avoids much of the more difficult math, and the [bachelor of science](https://reg.msu.edu/AcademicPrograms/ProgramDetail.aspx?Program=4728), which includes much more math and statistics).

Keep in mind your ultimate goals you have, leaving wiggle room if you end up having to change course for whatever reason. I can't say much to the environmental economics and public policy programs, but I am currently working on my BS in economics with my eyes on a PhD. MSU's economics department does punch above its weight in terms of ranking, due to our outstanding sequence in econometrics, which is effectively statistics' application to economic and public policy. However, it is very math heavy, and you'll of course focus exclusively on economics and learn little about public policy and almost nothing about public policy irrelevant to economics.

No, but strangely enough you're not the first person I've seen ask this. I feel like it's something that maybe one floor decided to do one year and the rumor spread to the point where now people assume it's ""a thing"", even though it most certainly isn't. Ask your RA about any special Halloween events that your neighborhood/building might be hosting.

&gt;Do people go to class in their costumes?

I've been in exactly one class with a guy who wore a costume. It's college so the attitude is very ""live and let live"" so he didn't get shit on for it or anything. But most people acknowledged it was a little out of the ordinary.

&gt;Do we do any Halloween activities in class?

Almost definitely not. Professors have a syllabus to get through and don't really have time to get sidetracked with Halloween stuff. I took a film class a few years ago where Halloween week was made to coincide with our study of scary movies, but that was it. If it doesn't fit the syllabus, they're not going to shoehorn it in.

&gt;Halloween is very big in my family and I want this to be the best experience of my life this year.

Honestly, most of the costumes come out on the weekend. People go to parties off Grand River Avenue and there's a lot of drinking. A **lot** of drinking.

Only gripe is we had a pipe leak and they had to fix it in bathroom but it was a small leak from cealing.

Got 100% of deposit back by writing down detailed notes on inventory checklist, taking photos/video of property move in and out, and repairing a damaged screen ourselves.

With rent crmc and others like it to be paid per senesterly. In general they require security deposit and cleaning fee typically due at or near signing, 4 months rent due Sept 1 ($550x4), 4 months due Jan 1, 3 months due April 1.

Crmc requires a parent surety agreement saying that they will be liable if you don't pay rent, cause major damages, etc.

Lease is one year less 10 days.

Disadvantages and my dad agrees on this is that it costs too much and may drive away people because in general cheaper to live off because of the meial plan. Living in dorms isn't much (~$2300) but because of the meal plan it's an extra $3000 roughly.

The best information you can get is that which you find and verify rather than that which is given to you by another person with their own motives and thus, professors that believe their duty to teach encompasses a duty to influence (as many in the social-political sciences field tend to believe) are not  a reliable source.

1. For one there are network effects. As you add more consistent bike infrastructure there will be more users and the getting into and out of the protected sections easier. It takes time for everyone to adjust.

Intersections have the highest rates of collisions, however, there are protected intersection designs that make eye contact and visibility better for users and reduce collisions by design. There are conflicts with the current design, yes. Can they be addressed, yes. How much does the university/East Lansing care and want to pay? That is the question.

Regarding (2), it's more about people getting used to the concept of a bike lane. It takes a while for both drivers and pedestrians to get used to that fact and to start paying attention to bikes on the lane.   

I, for one, love that bike lane on Bogue.  Bogue has very high pedestrian and vehicle traffic, so as a biker it was an extremely difficult road to navigate, I almost always found myself on the sidewalk (because I don't trust drivers not being distracted), and if you were biking when classes were out, it was not an easy task, especially to cross the bridge. The lane has made it a pleasure to ride up and down Bogue.

I did hear that one of the complaints they have received are the bus stops they had to decommission to fit the bike lane in.  That's obviously a concern for those that use the campus buses frequently. But there are solutions to that as well (Copenhagen has a great network of bike lanes and bus infrastructure, and they work quite well in unison.

I just think its important to restructure how our higher education works entirely \*before\* spending a very large amount of money every year. Is money better off spent on education than military? Of course. What I am saying in no way shape or form should a public institution cost 30 thousand dollars a year to do a mild job of preparing us for the future as I have elaborated on in my previous comment. We need to approach this thing from a completely new angle. 

&amp;#x200B;

You make the criticism that I have no proposals on how we should fix college. I think the government would be better off spending money supporting different programs that prepare students just as well. For example, I think students could learn a lot more from co-ops and internships than a classroom. The government could pay half of an intern's hourly pay, and the company, another half to take in more interns and teach them on the job skills and learn by doing real world work. If an intern gets paid 20 an hour, which is a higher paying internship, the government pays this student 10 dollars an hour 40 hours a week for 16 weeks, or 9600 dollars. That is a \~35% reduction in payment. I learned more at my 12 week internship than I did in any semester ever. I think if colleges could incorporate more co-op programs and make it part of a 4 year degree program, students would become much better off in the future, company's would have more incentive to take interns because they get away with paying them shit, and they would have a more prepared pool of students to pick from. The downsides? You learn less upper level classes that you may not even need, but if the student knows exactly what they want to do, and lands an internship and then succeeded at that internship they should not have to take classes that they do not feel prepares them for their future career especially if they have a firm grasp of what they need to know based on their real world internship. So there is one program.

&amp;#x200B;

Another is a bit more personal and complicated but personally I am math and pre-med. To get into medical school you need volunteer work, research, leadership experience and certain prerequisites. You do not need a bio degree or anything like that.  I took pre med classes while getting a separate degree and am graduating a whole year early. Medical schools only care about my pre req classes. I think pre professional degrees such as pre med, pre PA, pre law could all have more specifically tailored programs that are a year, even 2 years shorter and still offer the same advantages as going 4 year and getting some fucking random degree. I could have spent more time volunteering, being in a hospital, receiving medical training and even though I am graduating a year early most pre med students don't. You can save a whole year/30k by making more tailored programs like this. These programs should be restricted and available to top students is the only noteworthy problem with a program like this.

&amp;#x200B;

It is also worth noting that information is free, a degree is not. I taught myself 3 entire classes that I never took before in 3 weeks leading up to my MCAT and knew them comprehensively. I could have passed any final exam for these classes. It makes you think, if it is free to rip up a khan academy video, and a book to do practice is problems is 200 dollars at most, if I can show it on a well written standardized tests why shouldn't I get credit for the class? Because colleges want my money is why. I think the government should set standardized scores on standardized tests for certain entry level classes that allow people to get credit for them. Obviously the standardized test has to be very well written and obviously it should only be for certain classes like Psychology, where I learned and could apply everything.

Is Bernie Sander's plan a good idea? It gets the job done, but it lacks foresight, it just hurts me to see the most famous, bright and powerful people in the world come together to run for president and come up with nothing revolutionary or unique. I am a 20 year old math nerd and I could come up with 2 ideas that are at very worst something to consider that could reduce prices for education significantly while providing nearly the same, or much better experience for education. What I am saying is I would like people to talk about how we can reform education, then fund the new programs rather than just cover debt because it is possible to make things cheaper and better at the same time.

There are three movie theaters close to campus. Studio C is near the meridian mall, and is smaller and serves food. NCG is in eastwood plaza. Celebration is on South Cedar near 96.

Celebration is my favorite. They have the most comfortable seats (large boxy recliners). You can reserve seats online before the show so you always get decent seats and can show up as the movie is starting. Plus, they own studio c, so my reusable popcorn bucket works at both. They also have an IMAX theater.

Studio C is my backup for release nights as they tend to sell out of tickets later than the other theaters. They also serve food and beer, it is overpriced but sometimes it is nice to have a beer with a movie.

NCG is not bad, but you can't reserve seats online, and I prefer Celebrations boxy seats over NCG's bucket seats.

50-100 years ago higher education used to be about creating a well rounded liberally educated adult.  Now I think the goal of higher education has changed -- these are employee factories.  And we are pumping out employees without any real tangible skills or knowledge in the job market, and simultaneously putting them into huge debt.

What Bernie is proposing specifically is not throwing more money at the current system, he is overhauling the entire thing. In fact there is many valid concerns to simply just extending what we have now. Offering a little more grants and aid packages to people while its helpful to them, it actually contributes to colleges raising their tuition rates. Also keeping within the confines of the current system, it allows for grants and aid to be slashed like under the current administration (this is more important than you realize, thats why universal plans like Social Security and Medicare are so successful).

The problem with your rhetoric is it sounds exactly like a typical corporate establishment candidate who will make vague statements criticizing the current education problems, but when it comes time to actually address these issues and real solutions are put forward, they say ""oh this is just not feasible"" or ""this is just throwing money at the problem"".

9088,"So there's a few answers to this.  

(Before I begin, you wouldn't be funding everyone else's higher education (although, as a tax payer of whatever state you live in you already partially do); free college and student debt cancellation would be paid for with a tax on wall street.)

First, we need to accept that student loan debt is a problem.  It is.

1.  Economic (Bubble Burst).  Student loan debt is absolutely the next bubble to burst.  Wiping out student loan debt in one fell swoop would remove that bubble (which, when it bursts, is going to wreck havoc on the economy).  

2.  Economic Boon:  Moreover, wiping out student debt is going to be a boon for the economy.  As I'm sure you know since you paid off your debt, you could be using that money for something else.  Even if it all goes to avocado toast, it's going to be reinvested in the economy.  Cars, homes, vacations, etc; student debt holders will be doing something other than writing checks to the government for their loans.

3.  Demographic:  Millenials are waiting longer than ever to buy homes, get married, and start families.  There isn't one single answer as to why; but student loan debt is no doubt a contributing factor.  Removing that impetus will allow debtors to start building a family and preparing for retirement.

4.  Moral:  As pointed out extensively elsewhere, most of the industrialized world provides higher education as a matter of right for its citizens.  Student loan debt is held by working and middle class Americans trying to improve their lot in life.  We should encourage that.  There's all sorts of information about how income inequality, racial income gaps, and gender income gaps would be reduced by student loan cancellation and free college.  

So now that we've established that student loan cancellation is a good thing; you bring up the salient point - ""what about people that have paid it off.""

Unfortunately, Bernie's plan doesn't have any sort of clawback for people who have paid off their debt (none of the candidates do); and I think this is a weakness of the plan.  I would like to see a sliding scale for people that have paid off their loan; but, ultimately, people are going to be out money no matter how you do it unless you reimburse everyone forever (and even then between time value of money and inheritance, some people would still be getting the short end of the stick).

And that sucks.  100%.  Absolutely.

But, here's where I disagree with your take.  Just because it sucks that you didn't stand to benefit, doesn't mean it's not the right thing to do.  If it's the right thing to do (and I think it is, see reasons above), then that means we have to do it, now!  Since I left my parent's insurance, I've spent about 100K on insurance, RX, premiums, deductables, and copays.  That sucks.  That's money I'm NEVER going to get back.  But, we still need M4A, even if I'm never going to get that money back. 

Finally, you say ""That would mean everyone presently graduating has a huge economic advantage over me and tens-of-thousands of other graduates.""  I'm not sure I agree with that mind-set.  You and your neighbor are not competing as firms in an open market.  Yes, you may be a small business owner, or an investor, or any number of things; but if your neighbor wins the lottery, or inherits a million dollars, it doesn't make you WORSE off.  Same with the idea of student loan cancellation.

Like I said, it's terrible that there isn't a sliding scale for people that paid off their loans, and I think it's a real weakness of the plan (morally, economically, and electorally).  But just because the plan isn't perfect, or doesn't stand to benefit you personally, doesn't mean that it's not a positive thing, or the RIGHT thing to do.",0.1182,0.4913,0.3904

9092,"You're confusing investing with speculation.

Most Americans don't actively buy and sell stocks (hell, most American's don't OWN stock, but that's neither here nor there).  They have an IRA, 401K, or pension that buys ETFs or broad based funds and holds them long term for dividend and fund growth.  Yes, there'd be a small tax on that purchase, but it'd be one time.

It would absolutely negatively impact day traders and the big financial institutions that make money with frequent trading; but that's not going to impact the vast majority of Americans.  

Investing =/= speculation.  Ending investment would be horrific; but taxing speculation for something that would lead to an economic boom isn't.",0.0415,0.278,0.6805
9093,"Bernie isn't a one trick pony saying ""this policy is the end all be all cure to all woes.""

As for the specific question of mortgage vs student debt; there's a few answers (and I would invite you to look at his ""housing for all"" policy - it's not quite ""pay off mortgages"", but it would help people get affordable housing and end homelessness in America).

1.  There's a looming student loan debt bubble.  If there was a looming housing bubble (like we had in 07), we'd probably be concerned with that issue - but right now, the next bubble to burst will almost certainly be student debt

2.  Student loan debt is weighing down a generation.  Millenials and Zoomers aren't buying homes, aren't getting married, and aren't having children because of student loans.  That's a looming demographic threat.

3.  We can do it fairly cheaply.  There's about 10X as much mortgage debt in the US as there is student loan debt.

4.  Student loan debt would be an instant economic boost.  People would go spend the money they've been using on student loans on, amongst other things, home purchases.  If you wipe all mortgages, that money won't flow to home ownership.",0.1322,0.4242,0.4436

The flyer I questioned about posted by this questionable man.  When I called, he didn’t give me his name.  I decided to meet with him anyways because he claimed that “I’m the best physics tutor there is, I have practice exams and you’re sure to get a 4.0”.  When I met with him, he still didn’t give me his name.  He asked for payment in cash only and charged 100$ an hour.  Also, he made me schedule about 4 “sessions” at a time so I was forced to hand him 400 dollars cash.


This sounds like an absolute scam, but he was pretty helpful.  He went through the material and explained it in a way I could understand, but I was nervous the whole time because it all just seemed so sketchy.  He kept asking me to “work” for him saying that he needed someone to film him while he made physics tutor videos, but I always declined.  He was helpful but something was just way off.

And that's because most of the programs you will use are on the engineering computers and not available for your personal computer.

You do have the ability to remote into the engineering network from your personal laptop to use these programs, however you are still running off the network, not your laptop. So your laptop doesn't impact your speed that much.

I would suggest getting the computer you are most comfortable with, at a reasonable price point. Unfortunately the super cheap computers just don't hold up that well. 

My suggestion would be if you are planning on traveling to school with this every day, get something sturdy. Bumps and bangs happen and some of the cheaper plastic bodies don't handle it well. If this Laptop is rarely leaving your desk in your room you really don't need to worry about that.

The raw score goes up when you average {a,b,c}\min{a,b,c} vs {a,b,c} which means if there existed no curve then everyone gets a grade better than they would have...

But how is the change in curve going to change this?
Still sounds like a normal distribution problem but you rightshifted the mean?

9286,"Honestly, I naively conjecture the greatest variable lies in differences between an individual’s scores rather than overall placement.

Whether or not you want this system mostly depends on the *lack* of uniformity on the scores

In the case that your two highest scores are close and the lower is a relative outlier, then you wash your hands of it.

In the case that your highest score is a relative outlier and the two lower are closer, then you sample bias towards your atypically higher performance.

If all 3 are in a small neighborhood, you gain little by taking out your minimum.

The people hurt the most are those with most consistency, now they stay the most stationary relative to the others jumping rank (probably a lot of ranks for the people that overslept and missed 1 exam).

Now in this raw reranking, everyone is right shifted even though some people jumped others.

You’re asking if overall people get screwed by this?

And I am thinking most people benefit but a few niché people, I’m guessing people with 3 scores in a very narrow range (which also happens to be higher), suffer the most from this curving. But these people probably 3.5 or 4.0 the exam category either way with small subset bouncing between one or the other.

They have to lose to the curve more than in respect to the right shift they already received, which requires a narrow jump on that shift ⇒︎ exam scores close together.

Now, do not take this as a formal proof or anything, it’s a naive conjecture with a little logic applied. I could be fucking wrong.",0.0429,0.3169,0.6402

It helped that Wulff's final exam was comprised of 80% old quiz questions. Unfortunately it often depends on what professor is teaching. I took 351 with Huang who was a great lecturer, but Wulff was pretty rough for 352. Hopefully you have a good TA because that can be a lifesaver. I will say that you shouldn't be afraid to seek tutoring if you think that would help, as well. There should be free resources on campus for that. Also take advantage of office hours.

I have not taken these classes, but I'm assuming your course relies heavily on structural changes, reactions... boring and dry chem related crap. 

When it comes to topics like these, it's best to try and avoid the ""let me make flash cards"" approach that presents itself. Restart from chapter one, and try your absolute hardest to visualize these things as you are reading about them. 

After every explanation in a lecture, or a text that you read, ask yourself two things: Why? (Make sure that you understand it) and How?(Explain how it happens)

After, change something about the material. If it's asking about the flow of electrons in some specific reaction, find a different reaction, and see if you can correctly answer it. Make up your own question. 

These kinds of topics are a metric-shit ton of memorizing, when it comes to things like quantum physics, organic chemistry, and molecular biology, you cannot easily visualize things, so you have to adapt to the material.

I am a 4.0 student as well and my grades are my very important to me because I’m paying for my education by myself. I cant afford to not do well. I ended up getting burned out and completely exhausted (mentally and physically) during the spring semester because I was so worried about my grades. I stayed up late and didn’t take good care of myself, I was extremely depressed almost the entire semester. I stopped going to clubs and events that I enjoy because I thought that I had too much homework to do and that I wouldn’t finish it if I went to a 1 hour long meeting once or twice a week. That was a TERRIBLE idea because club meetings and events serve as a break from school. My grades dropped from all of this and I’m now trying to raise my GPA back up.

My point is, remember to do things that “fill you up”. You can’t do just school and homework all the time, you will get drained just like I did. Go to your club meetings, hang out with friends, take some time to care for yourself. It’s okay to not get an A on every quiz and exam.

Also know that there are many people who you can go to for support, whether that’s your friends, family, CAPS, or another resource on campus (or off campus). Your mental health is just as important as your physical health and has such a big impact on your everyday life. Try care of yourself and be a little easier on yourself too.

That being said, I still disagree with most of your stance on this being the consequence that is deserved. We aren't even dealing with the abuse and mistreatment of child immigrants, it extends to adults, and extends to U.S. citizens being wrongly detained. In a few cases, U.S. citizens have died.

The comment on taxing referred to current immigration policies beyond I.C.E. as well. Building a large fence will not stop this issue, and when combined with the cost of funding I.C.E., the facilities and the recourse when dealing with the wrongful detainment/deaths of U.S. citizens, it is definitely out weighing the benefits. 

Our immigration policies are currently used as an attack on groups of individuals. I taught in an extremely impoverished school the last few years. I have had to stop my plans for the day on several instances to deal with fearful hispanic students (who are rightful U.S. citizens). These students are seeing/hearing of these cases and worry that someone will kidnap their family. They have reason to fear. Strangers in the street will frequently taunt and yell at them. This issue (and many others) are being used to turn the voter base against each other for gain.

I do not believe for a minute that we should leave be and go unregulated. However, the current actions of the administration, and current policy has strained this concept, and muddied the waters. Our original philosophy as an early nation was that we would rather 100 guilty men go free than 1 innocent man be punished. Along those lines, we do have policies against cruel and unusual punishment. No one deserves to be tortured for their crime. Especially when it comes to illegally doing something to try and better your life. We sympathize with the man stealing medicine for his dying wife. But bastardize the man seeking a safe haven, to escape a life of Hell.

Specific football games, graduation ceremonies, weddings, etc. never will get rescheduled just because you're sick. So building toughness by going to exams/classes/etc. even when not at 100%, probably is a positive.

I think there needs to be like a totally-free (doesn't matter if you have health insurance, if you're international, etc.) service on campus, and if they agree you're significantly sick to the point that ""competing in academics"" is not going to be fair, they directly email instructors and arbitrate accommodations.",0.0445,0.3719,0.5836

So the sick student probably didn't get the best score they could have, but unless they wanted to jump through hoops (standard policy for missing an exam is 0%, sometimes syllabi even specify automatic course failure), they had to show up.

as for 234, if you dont have Maccombs as a professor, I'd SERIOUSLY recommend checking him out, he's a prof that really goes above and beyond for his students, because of MSU's deal with d2l apparently teachers' classes get wiped every two years so they cant make ""decent"" sites. so Chad maccombs straight up BUYS THE DOMAIN  [http://mth234.com/](http://mth234.com/)  and hosts his entire class through that.

I wouldn't be surprised if there are surveys or statistical analyses better evidencing an uptick in bigotry since Trump took office, but that's a bit beside the point. And honestly, I'm not invested enough in the conversation to bother looking (and I don't say that to denigrate your opinion; I just think getting into that stuff would be too tangential to warrant its posting).

As an aside, it's not exactly sensible for anyone to draw sweeping connections across history. History doesn't exist in a vacuum, but comparing a politician holding office in 2019 with one who served in the middle of the nineteenth century--or the twentieth, for that matter--does a disservice to how our country has progressed throughout its eras (and, in some respects and places, regressed).

So yeah, I do agree that it's silly to condemn Trump as the most racist president *in history*. After all, our first president owned other human beings.

Oh well. Frankly, I'm sick of politics. I'm on a tropical island, so I'm going to use my last night here to get drunk as shit instead of talking about Trump.

9939,"I think the common argument is that President Trump's rhetoric empowers racist people to be more vocal about their prejudice. 

And, from what I've seen, read and heard, I'm inclined to agree. I live in a small town a ways outside Lansing. Growing up, I occasionally heard strangers in the local corner-store mutter about immigrants and African-Americans. Nowadays, though, I'm hearing a lot stronger language a lot more often, most of it directed at various minority groups. 

Here, I don't think it's a good idea to ""stop being political."" You can defend or distort Trump's statements about ""illegal"" criminals and ""shit-hole"" countries to the ends of the earth and back. Hey--maybe Trump didn't even mean to come across as racist or xenophobic when he said any of those things; maybe the guy's just an insensitive but otherwise stable genius. 

However, I do not think it takes a great leap of logic to suggest that Trump's statements on race and immigration could act as an impetus for subtly racist people to express their sentiments more openly. A president who uses intolerant language sets an example for people who think similarly and are inclined to emulate their commander-in-chief. 

Thus, the problem isn't that racism didn't exist before Trump, it's that Trump has, at least in part, facilitated a socio-political environment in which racist people are more comfortable saying racist things. 

Please don't take me the wrong way. I think that sometimes politically incorrect discussions need to take place. Liberal institutions too often *do* stifle necessary conversation about religion, race relations and governance. But, at least in my mind, there's a big difference between asking questions about the scriptural underpinnings of Islamist terror and being A-okay with blatantly discriminatory immigration guidance and policy proposals. 

There's a reason Trump is an alt-right icon, and it's because many people who self-identify as racist believe he's at least partially on their side.",0.0238,0.2412,0.735

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.montgomeryadvertiser.com/amp/2777708002

Human trafficking does not have borders, but the belief that it entails kidnapping people off the street is just that--a belief, and one that is often without any truthful basis. 

Here's what one expert told CBS: 

""These types of stories perpetuate misinformation, which leads to people being misinformed about how human trafficking happens in real life,” she said. “It’s not like a Hollywood movie. People aren’t coming up and kidnapping victims like in the movie ‘Taken.’”

CBS also noted that, in thousands of interviews with trafficking victims, not a single one reported being kidnapped. I'm sure the case is different for migrants in Mexico, for instance, but we are not talking about Mexico.

Spreading rumors like this over social media is akin to fear-mongering. If anything, it obscures the reality of human trafficking in this country.",0.0111,0.1706,0.8183

10116,"I would say rather than the work ever getting harder or easier, what changes is how well-equipped you are for the work you have to do. I'm a mechanical engineering with a computer science minor, and the workload has remained more or less consistent throughout. 

The thing that has made the biggest difference in all my years here is my schedule. If your schedule isn't optimized, you're going to have a bad time. This is different for everyone, but an example for me:

I do my best when I begin around 10:00 AM, have about 30 minutes between classes, and they're all in the same building. If I can get a day off each week, even better! Why does this work for me? Because if I have three classes from 10:00-2:30 every day with a half an hour in-between that gives me stability (my schedule isn't changing every day), it gives me time to prime myself for any homework that was assigned in the previous class, or go over notes for the next, and it gives me enough time to sleep in the morning in case I have a late night. 

Contrast that with semesters where I had no days off, class at 8:00 AM, 11:30, 1:50, and 5:30 (lab) mix and matched on different days at different ends of campus. I was miserable - I wasn't sleeping enough, I wasn't making time to keep in shape, I wasn't eating properly, and I had to study twice as hard to keep up with classes that weren't even that difficult. 

With that optimized schedule came more ease with free time. If a friend wanted to go to Rama on Thursday I could say ""ok, I'm going to have to get up an hour earlier than usual and do the homework I was going to do in the evening."" &lt;-- I couldn't do that if I was already getting up at 6:45 of 7:00 for an 8:00 AM, but I can easily do it before a 10:00 AM class. Or perhaps there's a club that meets twice a week - though I've never managed to stick with it for other reasons - I was a lot better about going to clubs when I had a day or two off. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: Optimize your schedule and your life will fall into place much more easily. Have a bad schedule and you'll find ourself working extra hard to play catch-up.",0.3885,0.4393,0.1721

I've also heard from some reviews that the management are not the best and sometimes they charge alot.

Having my own bathroom has been amazing, and I feel pretty safe out here. I think the pricing difference between here and somewhere closer to campus is really just because of how far away the apartments are. As for the pricing between here and the other two locations, the club (mid range pricing) has a little bit bigger rooms and bathrooms, and bigger still for the landings(higher pricing). I’ve also noticed that as the price per community goes up, the general quality of the buildings goes up as well. They do give us free bus passes though, and while I don’t use mine too often, my roommate says that it’s pretty easy to get from here to campus via the bus. One of the biggest perks in regards to the busses is that the village is the first stop(or second? I don’t remember) on the 26 route to campus, so it doesn’t really fill up until after you’d be on.

It's mental health services on campus. I believe you can get 6-12 week (once/week) therapy programs for free with your tuition if you need them. I used them last year when I was going through some serious anxiety and it was really helpful. Just a structured time to speak with a licensed professional who can help you understand and work through your feelings - 10/10, highly recommend. 

\[If you need to go for longer than 6-12 weeks, they refer you to outside counseling services in the area more equipped for longterm therapy\]

Second, no worries, this happens to everyone. I'm in the same boat as you, graduating in December, but somewhat opposite in that I've been here for six years. My friends have graduated and moved on twice. There's no sugar coating it - its tough. I've gotten used to it by not letting it happen to me. During a year I spent working mostly alone in a new city, I was miserable. Didn't know anyone, say in my room 9/10 evenings unless I got up the will to go buy a pizza. That was until I got fed up with it. I was lonely, I realized I was going days at times without hearing my own voice or really talking with another person. So I began reaching out. I went to bars - not seedy bars, but hippy bars, ramen bars, coffee shops - I became a regular, I began chatting with anyone who seemed interested and open - even got lunch with a few of them. Biggest takeaway I found? Everyone is the same. Almost literally everyone has that worry, and has trouble meeting people. And the solution is something all of us have forgotten - how to make friends. We knew it once, back when we were five, but somewhere along the way we forgot. It's as simple as this; ""Hi, I'm thergoat, want to be friends?"" with extra steps of conversations and not literally saying that (but to each their own - try it a few times and report back, I'm curious).

The way to stop it from happening is to realize that it's controllable. You like mexican food? Find a nice mexican bar and strike up a conversation with the bartender after work at happy hour. Approach guys or girls who seem open to it and try to have a chat. Worst case scenario someone isn't interested and a conversation goes know where. Best case scenario, you made a friend! You like outdoors stuff? There are HELLA hiking and camping clubs in every major city in the country. Same for board games, book clubs, knitting circles.

You might be thinking ""I'm not good at talking to people though."" And maybe you're right. I'm not the best at talking to people all the time either. But that doesn't matter that much as long as you're engaging. I once went to a rum bar alone around 6:00 for half off appetizers. Turns out it was half off drinks, too. I ordered several of each. A woman (probably in her 50s) sits down next to me and begins looking over the menu. She can't seem to decide, so I tap her arm and say ""hey, if you aren't sure what to get, the cuban is \*fantastic\*."" We spent the next two and a half hours chatting about work and the US education system. I was meant to have been out with other interns, but they all backed out for one reason or another. Easily one of my favorite nights of the year.

Also, and I recognize this is derivative, but what makes you think you're going to lose your friends? My friends have graduated twice! They have moved on \*twice\*. What that means for me isn't that I don't have friends anymore, it means I have friends in California, Georgia, Ann Arbor, one full-time in Lansing proper, one in Chicago, etc. We keep in touch, we have calls, I visit one or two every few weeks, and I have the opportunity to make more friends here in the meantime. If you're worried about leaving such a youthful social environment...work hard to move to a happening city with a large young population and be active on the scene there!

That was longer than I expected it to be, but I hope it helps. Best of luck on whatever road your path takes you, and I look forward to crossing that stage with you in a couple of months!",0.2718,0.4874,0.2408

Another helpful tip: if you are ever with a group of people at the end of a club meeting or study group and some of them decide to go bowling / gaming / out to dinner afterwards, go with them even if you didn't plan to beforehand. Even if you have to stay up late doing work as a result, it's almost always worth it because you can really make friends this way since you all already have a common interest, being in the same club / class, and now you have the opportunity to hang out in a casual environment together.

Maintenance doesn't so anything and all 6 of them constantly paid $150-$200 over rent per person! My girlfriend and her roomates had problems with water coming out of the faucet at boiling point ( not over exaggerating) they called maintenance 4 times and put in 3 more requests. The office didn't do anything. A couple of weeks later the entire apt flooded becuase the water heater blew up. They had 4inches of water in the apt in about 8 minutes. The front office did nothing at first. her two roommates ran to get maintenance and maintenance came in and tried shutting off the water flow below what was left of the water heater. some of them burns and we're screaming because they needed to turn off the boiling water. It wasn't until that time that the front office gave them keys for a lesser apartment and gave them one hour to move out all of their stuff and then wanted to charge them rent for moving apartments. The front office said they would be there for two weeks and they ended up being there a month which was over into the next month and wanted to charge them rent again even though their apartment wasn't ready. once they got back into their apartment there was nails and dust and piles of garbage everywhere and The villages wouldn't come vacuum or clean the apartment they just had to clean themselves and deal with it. Skip to 1 month ago well after move out my girlfriend got charges from The villages 4 carpet and other damages in that apartment. They never replaced the carpet after it flooded they merely dried it and put it back down. So she had to go fight charges again  so she didn't have to pay for something The villages did on their own.

513 HILLCREST AVE is a ok.
Includes internet, heat (baseboard water/boiler), water, 2 or 3 parking spots (2 be got 2 spots, unsure 4 bedroom), tradh/recycling, on-site laundry, and 24 hr on call emergency maintenance.

Lease is 12 months less 10 days. Required to pay cleaning fee (~300-400), rent is paid pro rated (ex 1100 x 4 = 4400). You pay 1st months rent - $100 per person for August then the prorated rent of 4 months due Sept 1 and Jan 1. Last payment is  3 months (ex 1100 x 3 = 3300) due April 1.

Overall apartments weren't bad but between floor was loud so I recommd top floor if possible. Also get a portable ac unit because one or two built-in acs ain't enough boyz!

Secret to getting security deposit back is to take detailed notes on inventory checklist (due within 24hrs procession of keys), take photos/video of unit, no nail holes in wall, and if you fuck something up fix it and make it look like it never happened.

My gripes with CRMC is they encourage you to renew lease in October, some employee visited to see if they can install bathroom fan unannounced, quality isn't the best, they require a ""parental"" surety agreement saying parents will help if you don't pay rent, and that's about it.

Do like how responsive they are to emergencies and they dealt with some awkward situations between myself and roommate. Plus they didn't bother us for tours and shit as others say about DTN. Location was ok too

But the fact it got so real can be very triggering, especially when you’re ask to quantify your feelings so they can turn it in as a statistic. Kind of a big “fuck you” to probe someone that intimately in such a cold manner.

It may not be as easy to foresee the triggered group being this hurt when you just see the realness of the content, and not the effect of laying out something that heavy without any tact. Asking someone to rate their pain on a 1-5 scale on multiple metrics for multiple questions on such a personal subject lacks tact.

Imagine asking a rape victim to rate a set of victim blaming phrases on each of those metrics like this survey had.

You should start by looking up your college or departments faculty list and read their biographies, it should say what their research interests are. Send some emails and ask to meet with them to learn more about their work. 

also just a sidenote, professors are a little hesitant about working with pre-med undergrads because like you said yourself, you just want a research position to boost your application. A professor doesn’t want to work with a student who just wants a research position as a booster, that’s kind of a waste of their time and energy. They want someone who is fully dedicated to their research. Be careful about how you express your interest in doing research.

I’m not saying that it’s wrong to want to do research, of course it will help you in your future medical career. It’s just important to approach your potential research position the right way, you shouldn’t approach it as a “boost” for your application. It is a privilege to do undergraduate research, and it’s important to know that going in. If you do get a research position, you should fully commit to it. If you treat it as just a “booster”, your professor will know. And you won’t get the full potential out of the position as you could have if you were dedicated to it. Someone else could have that position, someone who isn’t using it as an application booster, someone who is there for the science.

It seems like the department did fuck up at the beginning by Falsely claiming their was not enough NSF funding for his PhD student to enroll in the course, which would have set the number of students to 5 which is enough. But also it is surprising to me that the department would cancel a special topics course (900 level) for having 4 enrolled. I had taken special topics courses during my PhD (engineering) that were allowed to run with 4. And Akbulut raises this point in one of the early emails. Then the department responds in the most passive-aggressive way by sticking an old seasoned prof in MTH124, rather than something a little more in his field of study. They usually stick the young professors in the really low level courses, unless an older professor opts for teaching them. I feel like they could have negotiated this point a lot more gracefully then they seemed to do. In fact when my PhD advisor had a special topics class that did not fire, he was not reassigned anything for that semester. And a 20% salary hit with such little delegation seems pretty aggressive a punishment for a prof of nearly 40 years.

BUT then this dude cannot let it go for YEARS. Like I would get being mad for the first year or two, especially with the large salary cut. But he never lets it go.

Just to go full circle to the very original comment in this thread.

It never is/was going to happen, but if the university somehow found it massively beneficial (like they would even consider such a change) then your pushiness about a very small fraction wouldn’t be enough to stop it, it wouldn’t even be close.

If they merely had the thought occur to them and opened public talks then maybe your concerns on top of other objectors could help them put this suggestion to bed.

“Maybe a trimester school is more what you’re looking for. But that’s not MSU.”

No shit on the second sentence, but if they decided it was a sufficient benefit maybe you’d be the one suggested to shop for new school if you couldn’t get over it.

If something like this happened, sign a year long lease or don’t take summer classes?

11087,"Disclaimer: I am a trans student, so my knowledge to CAPS pertains heavily on that perspective. I was also very familiar with the issue and what I wanted, there wasn't a lot of diagnostics in my session. I also only had one session, a screening session back in August of last year, so I can't say anything to the quality or helpfulness of the long term.

I'll describe a little bit of the process for going. Basically you go to Olin, the third floor is where CAPS is. You'll go in a request an appointment. They'll give you a clipboard, you fill out and outline some of the problems. After you turn that in, you'll go to a computer and take a longer survey I was super anxious and basically having a panic attack during my time there, so if I missed or don't remember something, that's why. Then you'll wait a little bit, a therapist will come out and invite you back to their office. The sessions last for 30 minutes to an hour, I don't remember how long mine lasted. During the session the therapist will ask you some context questions, try to get to know you. They'll also ask you what you're there for, what's going on, and what you want from therapy.

Depending on the answers to those things they'll either refer you off campus if you want ongoing therapy that they can't provide or they'll refer you in house to a therapist who you will have sessions with. CAPS is limited on resources so if you're like me and you wanted on-going therapy, they'll likely refer you out of the system. If they refer you out, the therapist will give you some recommendations for therapists and I think they're introducing a process for teaching students all about intake outside the university. I'm not sure if that's started or not, so don't quote me on that.

As for the quality of care, every therapist at CAPS is an accredited mental health professional. But that doesn't mean you're guaranteed to click with them. I really liked my screening therapist, they were awesome and referred me to two different therapists before I found the one that I really liked and have been with since January.

Are you going to tell me Illinois' offensive players are *that* much better than MSU's? The whole thing is ridiculous. Dantonio has never been a good offensive coach. His small amount of success is all thanks to a few good players over the years (Cousins, Cook, LeVeon, Langford, Burbridge, ect). And even with these players, the offenses were still mediocre. The bottom line is, the talent of these past players was able to cover up (for the most part) Dantonio's deficiencies as an offensive coach. Do I think Dantonio is a horrible coach? No. His bread and butter has always been special teams and defense and I think he's still capable of coaching these phases of the game at a high level. Instead of pretending like he or any of his buddies knows how to coach offense though, he needs to go *outside* of the program and give full control of the offense over to some young guy who isn't afraid to open up the playbook. A couple years of a non-horrific offense and we'll be able to start getting decent offensive recruits again. Not that hard.",0.1376,0.4621,0.4003

By entrusting our day-to-day IT operations  to Tech Mahindra, we can leverage their client-centric solutions to  improve productivity and scalability.***

#FAQ
##What does this mean?
The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

## Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

### Rudeness towards other Redditors

### Spreading incorrect information

### Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.

### Being a chad in my safe space (**This was your offense**)


## Am I banned from the Reddit?

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

## I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

## How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",0.0315,0.2894,0.679

Admission to the College of Engineering and a specific major provides access to enroll in certain courses required for the major. Enrollments in the College of Engineering are limited.

Admission is based on the cumulative grade–point average of all courses taken and a grade–point average calculated on mathematics, physical and biological sciences, and engineering courses.

For additional information, students should contact the Office of the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Studies, College of Engineering.

Minimum criteria for admission to the college are:

1. Completion of at least 28 credits earned after matriculation to Michigan State University.
2. Completion of Mathematics 132 and 133 with a minimum grade of 2.0 in each course.
3. A minimum grade-point average of 2.0 in all mathematics courses.
4. Completion of Chemistry 141 or 151 or approved substitution or waiver. Computational Data Science and Computer Science majors are not required to fulfill this requirement.
5. Completion of Physics 183.
6. Completion of Engineering 102 or Computer Science and Engineering 231 or Computer Science and Engineering 220 or approved substitution or waiver.
7. Completion of Engineering 100.

Freshmen and sophomores who have declared specific engineering majors (excluding Engineering Exploratory) are automatically reviewed at the end of every semester, and are either admitted or informed of their progress. Others may apply for admission during each semester, and applications will be reviewed after the end of each semester. Students must be admitted to a degree-granting college at the time they have completed 56 credits.",0.0493,0.7643,0.1864

11833,"HC student, no PA, engineering major. U of M deferred me, waitlisted me, and ultimately I chose to accept MSU rather than wait for their decision. I have many friends that went to U of M. My thoughts:

U of M is generally a better school academically, depending on the program you want to go into. As an engineer, the U of M name carries a little more weight and their coursework is generally more in-line with industry needs while MSU plays catchup (ex. for years all U of M students had to learn Matlab and I believe C++ - a full class of each. Until about two years ago, MSU engineers only had a half class of Matlab). 

The honors college offers many benefits I would recommend. For one, you don't have to take the standard university requirements - instead of IAH/ISS (typically standard humanities classes) you can substitute things like philosophy, logic/reasoning, economics. You can waive most prerequisite courses within reason. There are several built-in social events over the years that are enjoyable if a little flat. You get priority in class scheduling, which is a huge plus. 

At the end of the day, they're both major, respected universities. If you're going to get a good scholarship and honors college here, I would recommend coming here - if you don't like it after a year and you keep your grades up you can \*always\* transfer.

Off-topic, but MSU has - in my opinion  - a more beautiful, open, campus. U of M has a better bus system and the comforts that come from being intertwined in a major city.",0.8136,0.1703,0.0161

Honestly for the price difference I'd recommend 408 Ann St. It doesn't have free internet like crmc provides, but I like the fact it's a smaller landlord, the place is bigger, and build quality is much better. Plus they provide free heat.

Differences between 408 Ann and 915 lilac.

408 Ann st pros: bigger size
Dishwasher
Very close to downtown (1 block or less)
Free heat
Studio is licensed for two (not sure why you'd do this but whatever)
Windows (basement units) are brand new double pane glass
Very large ""wardrobe"" area
Built in microwave
Lots of lights
Walk in shower w/ tile surround
Small size landlord that seems to care (so far in my experience)
Between floor sound absorption very good
On site laundry (unsure it's supposed to be free but so it has been)

408 Ann st cons:
More people in building so possibly louder
Internet isn't free (we split internet up as whole apartment w/ wifi repeaters so still cheap $8-$10 per month)
Rent is more
Parking is a bitch (pulling in, some people park so have to call PACE &amp; tow company)
Next to frat house so noisy outside
Landlord is based out of Detroit so not local for repairs
Send check thru mail

915 lilac pros:
Free internet in rent
Oven and stove
Across from Cheryl Lane park (south neighborhood)
Relatively quiet outside
Parking is easy
Built in dehumidifier (least on ground floor unit)
Cheaper rent

915 lilac cons:
Smaller, like way smaller than 408 ann
Heat is electric base board hearing (possible higher energy bill)
Between floors is not very good acoustical
Windows are horrible quality and very dirty
No dishwasher
No laundry in any capacity
Shower is cheap ""durastall"" branded plastic cube
Had a shower handle break off
Build quality is very hit or miss

some simple tips I think anyone can do to eat healthier on campus

\- replace pop/sugary coffee with low/no sugar alternatives like water/coffee - I think changing this alone after my freshman year made up for all the weight I gained during it.

\- limit  getting dessert/pastry items to one/day or, better, one/week

\- avoid anything fried or at the “American” stations, this was tough for me because I love fries, tenders, and burgers.

\- try to eat a more Veggies (I did this by trying to eat at least one salad/day

\- for combos, i would get iced black coffee, a granola bar, and a bagel or some other entree

when I lived in the dorms a days meals might look something like this:

breakfast - omelette with veggies, fruit, and black coffee

lunch - wrap with turkey and veggies, salad, possibly another entree, water

dinner - whatever was around, a lot of custom options based on what was offered (my go to favorite was in Brody going to the tex-mex place and getting a make-shift burrito bowl with rice, chicken, guac, cilantro, and lettuce), salad if I didn’t have one at lunch, water

Definitely a lot easier to be a top student at MSU with a lot less effort than UofM.

I know guys at UofM killing themselves to be like 80-85th percentile. It can be rough, especially when a lot of classes you are competing with your classmates for the top grade. I only had 2 classes at MSU where I was graded against other students, definitely not something I like. 

MSU's engineering has a ton of connections too in industry. I've been on Co-Op/Internship ever since I was admitted and its gotten me a chance to build a really strong resume for full time work or grad school.

12012,"Depends on cost. If you’re paying the same, then UMich. If you have a a zero or two less on your bill at MSU, then MSU.

MSU HC is good, but I wouldn’t say it’s this esteemed thing people make it out to be. It also seems to be a bit of a crapshoot honestly. For example, I’ve met a couple people who are quite ahead of most other honors college kids, but they weren’t honors college themselves. And there are a fair number people I’ve met who I’m surprised got into the HC also (significantly more in this case). Also, honors floors tend to drink a lot, so watch out if that’s not your thing. “Community” just as easily means drinking for some things.

If you can get ADS here, then your decision is pretty much already made depending on how important cost is to you and your family. Most of the time a free ride to MSU &gt;&gt;&gt; UMich unless you’re like super wealthy or something.

UMich vs. MSU for some things is just a lateral move between the two, but for others it’s very much vertical, e.g. CS, some other STEM disciplines.

Also something to be aware of, most East Lansing landlords charge rent ""quarterly"" instead of per month. So for example instead of paying $1000 per month ($500 per person) you'd pay $4000 for one rental payment and the next $4000 and then next $3000 or something like that. They typically have people pay Aug 1, Dec 1, and April 1.

CRMC does payments more like first months rent, security deposit/cleaning fee, then September 1 first rental payment (4\* rent price), then January 1 (4\* rent price), then April 1 (3\* rent price).

Also CRMC requires parents to sign a ""surety"" agreement that basically says if your child doesn't pay rent, or causes major damages, then your on the hook.",0.2374,0.7174,0.0452
12288,"hey guys, a quick reminder of a few reasons not to be so harsh with OP/ reasons this might cause them problems 

-yes, SPAD is amazing and the opportunity to go to college without going into debt is unmatched and incredible BUT many people are given this award because without it they’d have NO other way to get an education. aka, they are severely economically disadvantaged and would not be able to receive education otherwise. and MSU is only going to give you this gift if you’ve worked REALLY HARD for it. so the OP is most likely not “spoiled” or ungrateful. just frustrated because maybe living on campus causes them issues such as: 

-someone receiving SPAD is probably not receiving any help from their family. this means they are probably working, and working a lot to fully support themselves. maybe they were able to get a higher paying job than anything on campus and want to live closer to that job so that they are able to work more. 

-maybe this person has health issues, physical or mental, which are made more difficult by living in a residence hall 

OR 

-maybe this person has a right to have housing preferences even though they’re on SPAD. just because this person is receiving this financial aid doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be allowed to want things or be frustrated. come on guys, just be nice and remember: as far as I’ve seen, SPAD isn’t really handed out to rich kids who don’t need it. it’s a way to help people who would be stuck in some really awful circumstances find a way to get out and get an education and better themselves. have some empathy, and don’t be so quick to anger, it reflects less on the OP and more on you :)",0.2356,0.4237,0.3407

I had some great friends help me on my final project when I had wasted 2 weeks doing literally nothing because of my depression.

Me: Hey! How's it going?

Girl: \*looks at me\*

Me: Do you remember me?

Girl: Uh, no

Me: Really? It was at that party last Friday.

Girl: \*pauses for a second and then says\* Sorry, I don't remember much when I'm crossed

I chose MSU over UMich for a few reasons: Better scholarships, research opportunities as a freshman, less pretentious student body, easier to be the top of your class.

I also came in with about 30 more AP credits here than if I’d gone to UMich. 

The MSU CSE department has some great faculty and some mediocre faculty, it’s hit or miss but we do have some great classes. 

Generally speaking UMich is higher ranked academically and a top tier public university. MSU is still just as widely known on a national scale. Both are great schools.

In terms for internships there are hundreds of recruiters here. I got my first internship summer after Sophomore year, and it was in Ann Arbor! (Yes the recruiters came to MSU from Ann Arbor to seek out MSU Students). I’ve met students here with internships at Google, Microsoft, and Facebook. 

 I’m sure it’s the same at UMich in terms of having good internship opportunities.

I tried to look into the one mechanical engineering club but at the second meeting they were doing elections on who wants to run it and it’s like I just got in there and you already want me to run the thing so I got overwhelmed and just felt it wasn’t right for me at the time. I tried to see if karate club was a match for me because I do karate back home but I didn’t really like the instructors or the style and it was all around an unorganized club. I was kind of shocked as to how much I love something back home but absolutely hate it here. So I tried to maybe do a casual club like the smash bros club but it’s all competitive there and I get smoked. I’m probably projecting too much but I feel like the only people in a club that can involve competition are competitive and they leave no room for beginners for improvement.

If you decide to head out again, I'd recommend sticking around for amateur bracket and trying to find someone close to your skill level. Amateur bracket can have a wide skill range as well so maybe watch some of the other matches and ask people if they want to play after, or ideally you'd ask the person you already were matched up with in bracket, and see if you can strike up some conversation from there.

For what it's worth, it annoys me as well that the club doesn't put more emphasis on brand new players and I suspect how you felt is not uncommon.",0.0356,0.3224,0.642

That being said, he made a declarative statement to the school, fans, and the rest of the college football world when he refused to fire his staff after consistent sub-par results on the field.  He bet on his guys and he lost, badly.  This year was his last chance - all of the assistant coaches were put on one year contracts, which all but spells out that they're coaching for their jobs.  Obviously, the results have been disastrous - yes, disastrous.  Dantonio expected more from his players, fans, and school and built it up to a CFP caliber  program.  That's a two way street.  He has to deliver on his end as well - he's definitely getting paid to.  Check out some of the articles from the newspapers - the stats they're spewing are pretty damning.  Dantonio has been somewhat lionized by his success, but that doesn't exempt him from reality... he's failing consistently.

I would caution you from separating the program from the head coach.  Obviously, they are not the same entity, but coaches know exactly what they're signing up for when they take the job and Dantonio knows it even better than most.  The program is his responsibility.  Period.  Extreme ownership applies very directly in this instance.

Personally, I'm glad the results are so clear on the field this year.  Hate to see an 8-4 season allow the mediocrity to fester.  We have our answers and the outrage is warranted.

I had three weeks notice of acceptance prior to the start of the semester, and it was not necessarily a friendly or easy process.

I've found it much easier to make friends at MSU than at community college, I've met some of my closest friends here.

DISCLAIMER: I am not a lawyer, please consult a lawyer or MI real estate agent to look over lease or your concerns.

One big red flag if lease doesn't have this then you'd better get a lawyer and Sue them.

NOTICE: MICHIGAN LAW ESTABLISHES RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS FOR PARTIES TO RENTAL AGREEMENTS. THIS AGREEMENT IS REQUITED TO COMPLY WITH THE TRUTH IN RENTING ACT. IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE INTERPRETATION OR LEGALLITY OF A PROVISION OF THIS LEASE, YOU MAY WANT TO SEEK ASSISTANCE FROM A LAWYER OR OTHER QUALIFIED PERSON.

YOU MUST NOTIFY YOUR LANDLORD IN WRITTING WITHIN FOUR DAYS AFTER YOU MOVE OF A FPRWARDING ADDRESS WHERE YOU CAN BE REACHED AND WHERE YOU WILL RECIEVE MAIL, OTHERWISE YOUR LANDLORD SHALL BE RELIEVED OF SENDING YOU AN ITEMIZED LIST OF DAMAGES AND THE PENALTIES ADHERENT TO THAT FAILURE.

You can find out what is required to be in the lease by looking up the Michigan Tenant Landlord Handbook. Goes over in detail rights, responsibilities, a sample lease, and provisions a lease needs.

They may be allowed to double charge an application fee to cover a background check but if it is part of the security deposit it cannot exceed 1.5x the monthly rent amount (ex 1 months rent $1000, security deposit cannot exceed $1500). If they have a fee that says refundable, it's part of the security deposit. Example of a violation of Truth in Renting Act via the MI Tenant Landlord Handbook:

Security deposit is $1500 and 1st months rent is $1000. There is also a refundable app fee of $300.

Because the fee is refundable, security deposit is $1800 and violates the law because it is greater than 1.5x the maximum amount a security deposit has.

If the lease Abbot has this kind of shit and others strange bullshit, talk to a lawyer and sue them because they can and will take advantage of others, so ya gotta stop em!

Also all leasing companies I've felt with (CRMC, Hudgins, Omni Detroit Holdings LLC) never did this kind of crap! DTN did require an application fee before lease is made, but it is allowed.",0.0256,0.2892,0.6852

My advice -- if you can make it work -- is to cut one of the CSE courses and try to take something else that will be less burnout-worthy.  Sounds like your current non-CSE course is a sizable amount of work itself.

- The url is a .com link, not a .edu

- the prefix is http, not https. The s stands for secure, and most scam websites won't bother to encrypt their site.

These are good checks for plaintext links, but it's easy to spoof a link, like so: [https://account.msu.edu](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ). 
To check those, hover your mouse over the link (or hold your finger over, on a touch screen) and it will display the link it's actually sending you to.

I didn't actually expect anything, I just knew it was possible. Then it happened.

The Spartans dogpiled in the bar and the bouncer made us leave but we were leaving anyway. Our walk back to the tailgate was like walking upriver past the crowd leaving the stadium and we sang the fight song the whole way back. 90% of the people we passed looked like they wanted to kill us. 5% of them actually said something mean and a handful actually bumped into us physically and told us to shut the fuck up.

13600,"**Bowl eligibility**

Bowl eligibility in college football at the NCAA Division I FBS level is the standard through which teams become available for selection to participate in postseason bowl games. When a team achieves this state, it is described as ""bowl-eligible"".

For nearly a century, bowl games were the purview of only the very best teams, but a steady proliferation of new bowl games required 70 participating teams by the 2010–11 bowl season, then 80 participating teams by the 2015–16 bowl season.  As a result, the NCAA has steadily reduced the criteria for bowl eligibility, allowing teams with a non-winning (6–6) record in 2010, further reducing to allow teams with outright losing records (5-7) to be invited by 2012.

Then, we need to get Beekman out of the office and get in a new AD, and get Luke Fickell. 

It's fairly unrealistic, but anything short of that is a sign that nobody with power cares enough to fix the football team.

Not a soul on that offensive staff would get a job outside of being an ""analyst"" at a P5 program, and I'd argue a competent G5 program as well. Dantonio had a VERY easy decision which was to rid the offensive staff of his buddies who were carried by good players almost half a decade ago. But he didn't, instead he went full circle on the ""pride comes before the fall"" quote and now they're right back to where they started in 2007. It wasn't hard, look at ND in 2016. BK fired a lot of their staff, and BK took them to the playoff two years out of that season. Don't use 2017 as a high point because that's a borderline fluke year, especially considering where they're at now in comparison after returning so many players. If Dantonio relegated himself entirely from the offense and hired an OC from OUTSIDE the program who could be named the successor in the future I'd be fine with him staying around. If not and he promotes from within or finds another old coaching buddy who is or isn't here, he needs to go, and MSU should stop bieng a second rate mickey mouse program and cough up money to get someone like Luke Fickell or make a stretch and offer someone like Clemson's OC the job. You have to constantly be changing in CFB if you want to survive, and this staff has displayed they cannot do that, and wasted another great opportunity with a stellar rush defense.

Since then, our recruiting has been very subpar.  We can't expect to have an elite team if we don't have elite players.  Coaching wise, Dantonio seems to have completely lost his edge.  His downfall as a coach is one of the most baffling and depressing stories in college football.  As much as it hurts me to say this, we need to make a change.

uhhh just thinking linearly, the core design classes are ok--the color and design should probably be two semesters instead of one cause the workload as it is now is insanely dense, but the other side of that coin is the other 3 core classes are way too easy. go figure. actual curriculum for graphic design bfa is extremely work intensive. no room for electives and most if not all of your core studio classes are about 3 hours long twice a week. it's a really big time investment right off the bat. quality of the course is almost completely dependent on the prof...take the harder classes because they pay off more in the long run. ""easy"" classes just waste 6 hrs of your time a week for no payoff.

the facilities are ok. it's great that the print lab is really fleshed out now. probably too few computer labs, but they all have good equipment. most of your classes will be the basement, which has a tendency for uhhh roaches and puddles and stuff but that's only every now and then... oh, and also, it's probably way more expensive to do art than most majors. even gd, the ""cheap major"", will have you spending hundos on printing. 

the advisor is um...well there's just one, who isn't available very often. she's nice but you'll probably have to fend for yourself a lot. the profs have a core 20% that are honestly exceptional and 80% that are just insufferable, or much better artists than teachers at the very least. some just shouldn't be teaching, or around students. tas are usually cool.

Mainly 2 reasons: I've been in that situation so I know the choices, second, as a former TA, I've dealt with undergrads that complain (every year) and have told them the same choices and every year, its the same response and whine. My standing recommendations were always: 1) If you can't hack it with the bad prof, take the class else after checking to see if it transfers to fulfill the credit requirement for the major, or 2) power through it and try to pass the class with the bare required grade. I get it, he is a bad teacher and you paid for it. Yeah, I got that part. Thing is, he is the one dishing the grades out and probably shouldn't be teaching anyway but unless you have a solution that doesn't require taking his class, then you're stuck to the Prof's weird whims. Yeah, you might not be getting 100K plus to take the class like others say but as a person that used to be in the OP's place, I know the options, the outcome AND the feeling they are going through.

I remember a programming class where the prof wasn't a great teacher but he knew his shit. TAs did most of the work too. People had to drop that programming class even though they were going to need that foundation for every programming interview they were going to head to whether it was for a junior position somewhere or as a Tech Lead at Facebook, Google, Cisco or wherever. Dude actually said: consider to drop the class if you can't meet the requirements, are headed to a bad grade OR realize that programming in this language or any lagnuage isn't for you. You may need more time or a different teacher to master the material in this class. Many sucked it up, including me. Point is, students have a finite amount of choices so I am giving my 2 cents. Do I ultimately care? Maybe. I do know that I don't have skin in the game but as an MSU alum, I know the outcome of what you can do if you don't loose your shit and knuckle own to just jump the hoops.

I also sympathize with the projects being imperfect and made by students - again, post problems you see on Piazza. Ask questions on Piazza. Constantly. 

That aside, I had to take 231 a year ago of my own choice in pursuing a CSE minor. Loved it - read the book, every project pretty much fell into place, and when I went to see Enbody he was very helpful. Never ever go to help room...

&amp;#x200B;

 I'm going to assume you're either a freshmen CSE, or a non-CSE major taking the class for fun or for a requirement. Let me tell you, it's all downhill from here. And not just in CSE, in college in general. Enbody is a \*saint\* with a very well organized class compared to the ""bad"" professors. The best outlook to have, and I say this without sarcasm, is to take it as part of the learning experience. There will be classes where the professor can't write clearly. Classes where the professor doesn't \*teach\* anything, but literally reads off lecture slides. There will be classes where the professor will sit down and play videos of his prerecorded lectures. It sucks, and the idea that we're paying to be educated to a farce. We are paying for the opportunity to be tested on knowledge relative to our peers by professors at an accredited university. That's it. Beyond the code of ethics at the university (and MSU isn't even very good at that...), professors are under no obligation to teach us anything at all. Curves exist because learning isn't relevant in modern education, just how well you learn relative to your peers. Some people in CSE 231 are killing it, I guarantee you. What are they doing differently? Are they studying more? Are they starting earlier? Are they figuring out all the material needed for a project ahead of time so it only takes 2-3 hours instead of 5-8?

If there's one bit of advice I can give you or anyone else building their schedule is that MSU Grades (website) will be your best friend. It allows you to see what the grades are like for certain professors in every class. And in the engineering college, a professor can really change the whole dynamic of a class and turn what should be an easy class into a complete chore. Ex. I took ME 391 with Wichman which was an absolutely grueling experience and my roommate had Modares which made it seem like a cakewalk. You will also find that the more people you become antiquated with over the years the better time you will have. The college gets really small if you find yourself interacting with the people around you, which also makes being in the labs a blast because you'll always have someone to chat/work with.

You make some good points about the live coding.  I actually use VS Code for my own development, but switch to emacs in the classroom setting for two reasons: 1) It allows a larger font so that I can easily make the whole screen fill with code, and 2) the slowdown actually gives me time to think, as I usually AM trying to think out loud as I go about solving the problem.

As a solution to that issue, it sounds like it might work better if I limit the live coding to supplemental videos that are kept more concise and pre-scripted.  I've been thinking about doing more of those anyway.  That could also allow me to do a partially flipped classroom where the students can spend time coding in small (2-3 person) groups with regular input from me and other course coordinators.

14237,"I will say you are one of the better professors in CSE I have had. But for me, I personally have an extremely short attention span. I try but I can’t help it. If I’m not actively working on a project, my mind wanders, I open up a textbook pdf and start reading, or writing code, or thinking about semi-related topics. I wish I could but there’s so much going on I can never focus in a lecture

So for me, the issue is the live coding sessions. While I think the concept is good, the execution can be improved, namely through the use of an IDE. Jetbrains made CLion for a reason—it speeds up your development time. So to watch you just type everything out, and then make a type (which is not your fault it happens) and then go back, and then edit out of emacs and then run the code, there’s just a lot of stuff between your explanation and the actual material I need to take away. So I zone out and end up reading related C++ or python articles online, and when I come back I ended up missing some stuff and now I’m behind. So I know it’s my fault for not being able to stay focused but I think a big fix for this would be to use something like CLion for live coding

It would save you a lot of keystrokes. Your limit to how fast you type; would be how fast you talk, allowing us to focus on *what* you are saying, not physically *how* you are writing it.

So to address the Original post, I wouldn’t say you’re a bad professor by any means, but computer science as a subject is about *doing*, not *observing*, and I think that’s something that most professors (except for Owen) also struggle with

I do think the idea of the group-based workshops is good, but the problem is myself and most other CSE students are autistic so it’s usually just awkward for us and we don’t get much done. So I guess that’s a little on us for not getting out as much as we could with it. I work in groups of 2-3 better

I had some great professors outside CSE in PHY, MI, BUS, STT, other subjects. And I think they just set the bar really high for what is a good professor to me.",0.1737,0.4402,0.3861

For one, like someone said, the safety of walkers and bikers. More traffic will inevitably lead to more accidents. Also, increasing concentrated burning of fossil fuels in an area with high population density (like a college campus) is never a good idea. Parking rules aren’t just in place for MSU to make money, as you accuse them of. They ticket to also discourage students from repeating the behavior. MSU probably knows a reasonable number of cars they want on campus at any given time, and recognizes there are better uses for space than another empty lot for people to park in (new dorm hall to increase incoming class, buildings for classrooms).

There is room for improvement in parking, though. I believe implementing a smart parking system connected to the Spot On app would be a great idea. Let people know when and where there are spots open before they get in their car, reducing unnecessary driving around with no real destination.

Glenwood and Berrytree are close-ish to campus and decent places/floorplans. They both have a washer/dryer in the apartment. Iirc they don't have roommate matching though. Glenwood has an outdoor pool if that's your thing.

The Lodges is a little further away but it's a really nice place and they have a shuttle that goes onto campus which is handy. It has a washer/dryer in the unit too and they have roommate matching.

There's a couple of neighborhoods way north of campus called Chandler Crossings that are decent but the natural lighting in the ones I've been in was garbage so it felt a little dingy. Otherwise the amenities are really good and if you live in one neighborhood you can access the clubhouses/gyms for the other three so you always have access to a gym/pool/misc sports facilities.

I lived in Owen for two years and it definitely has a lot of perks but some drawbacks too. I've made a quick list below

  
**Pros**   
\- it's all upperclassmen/grad students so it's quiet and generally a good place to study  
\- they clean your bathroom for you weekly   
\- right across the streeth from the wharton center which gets pretty good shows/musicals every year  
\- decent places to get food nearby   


**Cons**  
\- the water is nasty though that's the case with most on campus locations in my experience. You'll definitely need a water filter but sometimes that wasn't enough for me so I'd just buy jugs or bottled water  
\- the single rooms are really, really tiny and the double-as-a-single probably isn't worth it in terms of price (but it's very spacious)  
\- if making friends is a priority for you, I'd say Owen isn't great for that (people are quiet, not a lot of floor/building events) and honestly most on-campus places aren't unless you're an undergrad freshman living with other undergrad freshmen",0.2398,0.4586,0.3017

&gt;It is common knowledge that college classes are longer than 30 minutes, and many are longer than one hour. So why does MSU put these spots on campus, right by halls such as Wells, Kedzie, and Bessey where many classes take place? 

It is also common knowledge that the university has obligations, associations and interactions with non-students. That includes workers, suppliers and visiting faculty. If 30-minute limits were removed on the spots right outside of residence halls, they'd be occupied all day by students with enough money to ditch their vehicles there. What happens when someone needs to make a delivery to a building or has a brief appointment? 

If anything, I think the university should continue to gradually remove infrastructure which currently encourages the use of private motor vehicles on-campus. Parking at the commuter lot is not expensive and it is not horribly inconvenient, especially given that CATA is now free. 

However, I do feel that parking on-campus is prohibitively expensive. Per-hour rates *should* be lowered. 

Regardless, over-reliance cars is a big part of the problem here. We do not have enough space on campus to facilitate more parking structures or more open-air lots.",0.0548,0.324,0.6211

That reminds me of another True story

I saw that anytime one of the girls would drop a bosco stick they would tell the lunch ladies and they would give them another

So I had a brilliant idea. I ate my entire bosco stick except for one bite and then dropped it. They let me get another one. I get back to the table and my friends are all laughing and like 5 of them run over to get a new one the same way I did. I said no, spread it out, it's too suspicious. But they ignored me. Not suprisingly, the lunch ladies seeing 5 kids who all dropped their bosco sticks on the very last bite at the same time, they refused to give them a new one. They also came to my table and took mine away.

The next lunch, there was a paper flyer in the cafeteria that said If you drop a piece of food and ask for a new one, you need to show them the piece you dropped and then you get the same size.",0.1124,0.4406,0.447

I understand why wolfish was added, but I'm arguing that it didn't need to be. In that very same sentence, ""one gnaws"" was already used. Notice that ""gnaws"" is a verb that can stand alone and doesn't require an adverb to relate back to the theme. I believe this is enough, and anymore would be interpreted as either redundant or the writer displaying a lack of confidence in the reader/his writing. 

Moving on from that sentence, ""a forlorn bag of stale doritos"" also could be revised. ""Forlorn"" and ""stale"" invoke similar imagery, and the writer need not bloat his writing with two words essentially implying the same thing. 

I'll stop here, as my critique was unwarranted and this piece satirical, but I hope this perspective helps improve future work.",0.1714,0.561,0.2676
15087,"The usage of ""wolfish"" was intended to link back to the imagery of the wolf in the wall mentioned in the first stanza. This is to reinforce wolf related imagery, and illustrate the subject's belief that the wolf mentioned is a physical creature rather than an existential threat, capable of being imbued with various characteristics.

If the following line simply read ""one waits with wit"", I believe it would hamper the reader's understanding that it is the rat doing the gnawing, and the wolf doing the waiting. While I do certainly agree with both you and the article that impactful prose has no room for vague adjectives and adverbs, I also am of the opinion that these bounds must be occasionally flexed during the exercise of poetry if the poet hopes to evoke any sort of response from the reader.",0.0539,0.6428,0.3033
