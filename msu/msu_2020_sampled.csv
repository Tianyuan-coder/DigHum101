Our Computer Science Engineering program is fantastic.

Our other engineering disciplines are considered average, maybe a bit better.

We are a public university with a very long history and many proud alumni.

Our campus is beautiful in all four seasons, except that crappy, dreary part of winter.

Celebrities bribe people hundreds of thousands of dollars to get their kids into whatever universities they can because they have no scruples of any kind. Can't get MIT, try Stanford, Harvard, U of M, Penn State, MSU - keep going down the list until you find someone willing to take the money, just as long as they didn't have to earn it.

I'm not one to sing MSUs praises. I couldn't stand a lot of my time there. There's a lot that needs work, academically and administratively. But to have no idea why people have a connection to the school? Like any university, people have learned there, grown there, met friends there, met spouses there, made memories there, started careers there.

Some people have what they would characterize as amazing times at MSU. Imagine, for a moment - you came on scholarship, joined a club that became or continued to be a lifelong hobby, met your husband/wife at that club, made friends in your classes who you spent hours with (and probably lived with at times). You graduated and got a good job with the help of the career placement office (which in my opinion as an alumni is second to none in the country) that allows you to comfortably support yourself.

51,"Woah, careful there buddy. These facts are not allowed on this doomer sub. It doesn't matter that it is True that even before covid [20-30% of death certificates were incorrectly labeled](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2020/04/25/coronavirus-death-toll-hard-track-1-3-death-certificates-wrong/3020778001/) and during a pandemic such a now there is reason to believe that number is currently higher. 

Hospitals having a [financial incentive](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/04/24/fact-check-medicare-hospitals-paid-more-covid-19-patients-coronavirus/3000638001/) to label people as covid patients. Yes, I did read where the article says there have not been reported cases of this happening, however it would be asinine to just state that it never has happened or that the possibility for it to happen does not exist. 

Especially with hospitals hemorrhaging money due to elective procedures being put off, but lets forget about the ""excess deaths"" of people dying since they either willingly or forcibly are putting off elective procedures. It is so bad that in the middle of a supposedly new black plague, they are [laying off or furloughing](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-02/coronavirus-california-healthcare-workers-layoffs-furloughs) employees.

Let's also ignore Sweden who never locked down and is now having their cases [take a nosedive](https://www.newsweek.com/sweden-which-never-had-lockdown-sees-covid-19-cases-plummet-rest-europe-suffers-spike-1521626) and not even considering [implementing further ""protections""](https://fortune.com/2020/07/29/no-point-in-wearing-mask-sweden-covid/). They are pretty comparable to us in Michigan, they have a population of 10.23 million and we have a population of 9.987 million. They have 10k less cases than us, and 700 less deaths than we have. But, did they gain anything from not locking down? Besides not looking like absolute fools that is.

They actually did. Relatively speaking that is. In May they had a [0.4% GDP growth](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/29/coronavirus-swedens-gdp-actually-grew-in-the-first-quarter.html?__source=sharebar%7Cfacebook&amp;par=sharebar). However, now they are expected to finish the year with a [1.5% decline in GDP](https://www.aier.org/article/the-economic-performance-of-coronavirus-sweden/). I cannot find the individual numbers for Michigan, but the US as a whole experienced a 8.225% [shrink in GDP](https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/jul/30/lloyds-shell-report-big-losses-covid-19-as-markets-await-german-and-us-gdp-business-live) over the second quarter.

Some medical examiners are doing post mortem testing if they have the means. But with tests in short supply, that’s not always possible.

EL is a college town and that's all there is to it. Venturing into Lansing you can find some cool spots and restaurants. EL is very affordable.

Again, EL is a small town and there's not much to do within EL itself, but if you're an outdoors type you should be fine with the surrounding area. 

There's a lot more to do in Ann Arbor in general, but to me what sticks out is the food. There are just so many more options in A2 than EL and it's not really a contest. However, A2's cost of living (and food prices) is much much higher than East Lansing, especially if you're looking to live downtown. One of the main reasons I chose MSU over UofM is the arrogance of many (not all) of the students at Michigan. There's a lot more places to shop in A2 as well - it's just a much bigger place.

If you wanted to try yourself I suggest taking  the mattress off and then taking the first extension post off then carefully position yourself underneath the bed so that the bed is resting against your back and then take the second extension post off (careful to not let it fall on your toes it weighs probably 20-30 pounds and is made of metal and wood) and lower it to the ground with your body.

The best/Truest advice I can give you is so vague as to be useless- milage varies. Mileage varies in bizarre and unexpected ways.

This was the same semester, with the same professors.

Also, any advice you receive is contingent on professor. Professors in these classes are given a great deal of creative freedom, and it reflects. For example, Dr. Shen taught 418h when u/Rasmaellin and I took it, and he diverted the entire second half of the course to discussing representation theory, his field of research.

Another idea is to find a job that you can work earlier shifts so you have your entire afternoons to work on homework. I worked 7-2pm 3 days a week. That was a little over 20 hours and was perfect. Waking up early sucks but being done by 2pm was great.

Suddenly you've got like 65-70 hours to work with. You really gotta make it count, when you are being productive. For me the key is not half assing it while I am working on school stuff. Work in a group or in a tutoring resource center if it helps you stay on track + it is socially rewarding. 

Be deliberate with all your planning. Get HW done as soon as possible so you aren't under the gun and creating artificial stress.

also if you can, i would watch netflix or listen to music while i was doing some homework like calc or orgo or gen chem. if it doesn't distract you too much, it can make you feel productive while still chilling out a bit. i also strongly recommend finding a place on campus that puts you into a work zone. i didn't find mine until my second year, and the amount of work i got done skyrocketed while still working 15+ hours.

Whereas other species become dominant through brawn and bulk, the James Madison males seek dominance through brash personalities. The male with the strongest adolescent conditioning for abusive debate will often chase off the lesser males. 

This ‘congress’ (as the group is called) will begin their routine by sending out mating calls. When they are inevitably ghosted, they set out to the local watering hole, Rick’s all american cafe.

Maybe the best part for me was the quality of the professors. They were all amazing, and they didn't hesitate to offer advice on things outside of class (like choosing between graduate school and law school, what the application process looked like, etc.)

I don't regret choosing JMC; it was the first time in my life that I faced a real academic challenge (Professor Petrie skimmed a few sentences of my first paper, handed it back to me, and told me to rewrite it), but the school provided everything I needed to succeed.

One thing, though: the degree itself isn't super useful if you end up deciding that working in politics isn't for you and also choose not to go to grad school or law school. So if you aren't convinced that one of those career paths is for you (and I strongly encourage you to explore different careers just to see what's out there), consider a second major in something more practical. I'd say accounting, but everyone I knew in JMC hated math.

I was a CCP major so I had to have a related area of study in addition to all my other classes, and it actually was so much fun studying a specific area and made the degree a lot more worth it to me than when I started college as only a poli sci major. I'm also getting my masters and then going to law school after and JMC has prepared me so much in terms of higher schooling and being prepared for more advanced reading and writing.

As for the personalities there's definitely some characters in the college, but from my experience there's also a ton of really down to earth people as well. It's all about finding people you mesh with, just like in any other college, and honestly might be a little easier in JMC since the classes are so small. My major was pretty small too so I got to know a ton of people in my major. 

For internships you have a ton of different options. I've done a few (political campaigns, state senator, refugee centers, and now I have a job at a law firm while I do grad school).

991,"Hi there! Single Mom Applied Engineering student over here who has worked at minimum 15 hours a week while taking 12 credit hours during the semester.

Some things I have found over the course of my education that have helped me to balance my time.

Jobs: 

Apply to Jackson National. They are currently hiring Strategic Support Associates. You give them the schedule you can work around your classes. They schedule you to this schedule according to business need. You can work a minimum of 15 hours/week up to 27 hours/week. The pay isn't  best, but it's competitive with MSU on campus jobs. Last time I worked there it was $12.50 an hour. The work is highly standardized and it's mostly data entry or validation of some kind. However, it's not super demanding and might even feel like  bit of a relief from the strenuous engineering courses! Being able to make your own schedule is a huge plus semester to semester. Plus, if you're in the MSU area over school breaks you could even increase your availability to 27 hours (or sometimes more if they are requesting hours for support) to make extra cash. 

EGR 100 Lab. If the EGR 100 lab run by Dr. Morgan is requesting support this year, apply for it. You won't get the 20 hours/week that you are looking for but it will still work around your school schedule which is optimal. I think the pay was $11/hr when I worked this job. I cannot remember exactly though.

During the 2018-2019 academic year, I put together a total of 4 part time jobs (about 25-28 hrs/wk) and managed 12 credit hours. The two jobs I listed above were 2/4 I had that year. I was manage my time even with my daughter decently while maintaining a 35 GPA.

How do I balance work and school? 

I have a planner that is color coded so that I can identify which classes require my attention first depending on what is due. (Ie. Calculus classes often took a majority of my time to complete homework/study, these classes ranked highest on my priority lists. If you aren't done with Calc yet, once you are you will see a substantial amount of time freed up :) .) I also echo what others have said about getting things done ahead of time. Waiting until the last minute to complete your homework is only going to cause you more stress. 

If you can get into a place like Jackson National where you will have a set schedule each week (usually), it will make it easy for your to identify what areas you need to focus most and what tasks can come secondary to this. Having a set schedule will help you to identify where you have free time to work on homework, go to the help room, do laundry, eat ....whatever. I think its crucial to have a set work schedule so you can plan your time accordingly! 

Also, another thing that I do pre-semester is find all of the class materials I can and start to review the material prior to the semester starting. Even if I can only do this with one of my classes, its one less class that all of the information is entirely new to me. I often will choose a hard class to review early (Physics, ECE 345 etc.) I know the thought of looking at class material before it starts is laaaaame. Who really wants to look at class stuff early anyway? But it really can help. Seeing material for a second time can making learning less daunting (at least for me). 

DO make time for yourself. It is the one that I have not done well enough throughout my undergrad and I am absolutely exhausted at the end of every semester due to the lack of focus on my own personal health/sanity. Find ONE thing that makes you happy. Reading, journaling, walking, Minecraft (whatever it is) and make time for that thing as often as you can.

And my final word of advice that I give to my peers who are much younger than I (often times many of year are approximately a decade younger than me :) ). It does not matter if you get done in 5 years with your degree because you have to work your way through school or because taking 16 credit hours a semester is too daunting of a task. I PROMISE it will be okay to get done a year or two or three later. Get your degree done in your own time. And your GPA will matter much less when your resume shows how much you worked throughout your undergrad. 

Best of luck and I hope you find the best pace for you!",0.3286,0.5574,0.114

Firstly, you should prepare yourself mentally that you will face some time crunch at times and therefore you will have to modify your daily schedule and possibly learning habits as needed.

Secondly, I used a spreadsheet to track the number of hours that I was studying for every subject that I had enrolled in. I think that was very efficient for me personally. After every midterm, if there was a subject where I felt I did not do as well as I had expected then I made a note to increase my daily hours to study for that particular subject. I does not have to super fancy but I do recommend on tracking on how many hours you are putting into each subject.

Thirdly, for the hours you spend on studying, please do active studying WITHOUT any distractions. I usually put 1-hour timers for myself and would not allow myself to do anything that would distract me such as browsing youtube etc... Having said that you do not have to spend 8 hours studying every day even. There were some days where I spent 6 hours studying and some days just 1 hour. Instead, try to look at how many hours per subject have you put in weekly and recognize if that much input is working for you or not.

They apply second semester. Deadlines are middle of march, and beginning of april, i believe, for the case study first and then the profile.

Case study is a small essay, 2 prompts about a business scenario. I didnt study for it, and finished in half the time. As long as you are reasonably logical, make a good argument, and throw in a key word or two, you should be fine.

Profile is just an over glorified resume. You list and describe your work, volunteer, student experiences and try to sell yourself to the admissions people. Took me all of 3 hours to get everything done and dusted. I wouldnt fret about getting in. As long as you have a 3.85-4.0, you should hypothetically be good to go. 3.7+ is good too, but you have to try harder on your profile and case study which sucks. I believe 3.7 was the cutoff, correct me if i am wrong. We did have covid so the gpa stats might be a little fucked up with the pass/fail system.

As for general advice, have a god damn good idea of what career field you want to work in. Generally you wont be expected to do anything business related, but not doing so can and probably will hurt you, i speak from personal experience. If the field you are looking into requires freshman to mingle and kiss up to recruiters from certain companies, then you better get on it because it can mean the difference between getting the summer program/internship/job and not. And once you’re behind, then theres no denying that you’re behind which sucks ass. 

As a general rule of thumb have a game plan, research, speak to advisors, and think through things. You should be fine if you do all that. Best of luck.",0.1578,0.4087,0.4335

Not your question but some useful information:

0. Have stable, constant hours for work. Know when to arrive every day.

1. Be upfront with your bosses about the fact you're working 40 hours weekly. You don't want them to think you're coming to work stoned or drunk. 

2. Read your syllabus thoroughly and have a calendar well scheduled. You must schedule time to do homework, studying, etc. 

3. Sleep on campus so you don't need to get to campus for classes. It's not ideal and facilities will tell you to leave, but it will cut your commute time (it was 1.5 hours daily of driving). PM if you need advice on where to sleep. 

4. To add, SCHEDULE SLEEP - you will end up sleep deprived and want to do nothing but sleep. You have a strict schedule to follow. If you have free time, please do sleep.

5. Don't forget about HYGIENE. Find somewhere to shower - if you smell bad, you'll get fired. Also, BRUSH YOUR TEETH - dentist are very expensive (learned the hard way). If you need help on finding a shower on campus, don't hesitate to PM.

6. Shave. Daily. If you look homeless, people will think your homeless. (Or be lucky enough not to look awful unshaven).

7. Don't steal from MSU's Sparty's or MSU's cafeteria. They'll eventually catch you. You'll get fired from your jobs. There's a nearby food bank if necessary. Don't bother applying for EBT, Michigan will reject you as you make too much.

8. Don't tell anyone your housing instable. People will treat you differently. 

9. Don't park on campus. Don't park near campus. Park at Meijer and take the bus to MSU. 

10. Schedule social time. This is something I didn't realize was important until I temporarily places on leave (MSU's COVID response) and realized I had no friends. 

11. Have a plan for getting calories and nutrition.  I used to buy powered Soylent and had 4 servings (1600 calories) as with taking daily multivitamins. I forgot to eat for the longest time.",0.0666,0.3464,0.587

The choice was pretty clear after that. The total cost only ended up being about $1000 and the way I look at it, I paid $1000 to not have to roll the dice on a potentially shitty room mate.

As a resident of Hawaii, we are dealing with our own issues right now of rampant community spread of COVID, we currently have one of the worst percentage rises of positive cases in the nation.
Right now, businesses are dealing with a lot of issues due to the lack of tourism and people coming out to certain tourist destinations. With our COVID quarantine process of incoming visitors, the 14-day quarantine is the only one that blankets the nation and we haven’t had many issues since the implementation of said program.
However, the issue becomes the local population not wanting to be taken from us. With the whole situation of two business buying out a bunch of hotel rooms for online universities, locals see it as our land being taken advantage of. We are worried for those who come here thinking they can do whatever they want, then finding out they can’t do anything that makes said experience what they wanted (hiking, beaches, restaurants, bars, etc.).
I agree on the part that students might be safer if they stay committed on staying contained in a single hotel room for two weeks or longer, but at that point why not be home.

Hawaii already has a mandatory 14-day quarantine that is required for all passengers that specifically requires those entering the state to designate to a hotel or motel as their quarantine location along with temperature checks before boarding aircraft. Additionally, while it is True that all city parks, recreational facilities, campgrounds, etc. are to be closed some parks will remain open for ocean activities such as surfing, solo paddling, and swimming. 

Normally I would agree that such trips are unnecessary but I can see the appeal for a change of pace, if and only if strict social distancing and public health guidelines are followed.

I'm a current TA and I run exam review sessions so I've had my fair share of students who are in your boat (approx. 75% come in with no programming experience). As everyone has been saying, the class is made for people who have no experience. I didn't have experience programming when I started too.

First, start early. The first 3 projects can be deceiving since they really only take students 1-4 hours to complete. After project 5ish, the time to complete a project increases drastically and it catches people off guard. 

Also, once you have an issue that you've been going at for about an hour, ask your TA. It doesn't help anyone, especially you, to sit hammering at your code and potentially making it worse. Just ask us. We can solve just about anything after teaching a semester or two. We've seen it all. I had a student wait to ask me about dictionaries for 3 weeks and by that point he was so far gone I couldn't save him unless I worked with him everyday for hours. Please ask us if you have issues! We love to talk with you! It's our job!!

Finally, be careful what you read on websites (stackoverflow). Now, I love stack. Use it all the time for bugs. But as a student learning something new, stack can often deceive you. I catch cheaters using it. So does Enbody. We actually caught a handful of cheaters last year because someone posted incorrect code on slack and they copied it. Piggybacking on that note, don't cheat! It will only hurt you.

As for websites, codecademy is one I always recommend. They only have python 2 for free (we use python 3) but the basics are the same: types, if statements, loops. I recommend starting with those and if you feel pretty good try functions.

1296,"I did not take CSE 231 and am not a CS major. I'm entirely self-taught and have been programming for 5 years, so I can offer a few tips that may help you to start. 

Start with Python. I think you'll have it in CSE 231. I started out with C and then C++, and it was awful.  It took me a long time to confidently write programs in C++ since I'd always have scarry errors that did not make any sense at the time. In Python, things are way easier. You will have C++ in CSE 232 (if you decide to take it), but I think it's much better to learn a few things about operating systems (in particular, memory management) before diving into C++. You can also play around with an assembly language (after Python, of course) before learning C++. As for learning Python, you will find everything you need [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/53z5p4/how_to_start_learning_python_the_complete_guide/). 

Secondly, you will need an IDE for Python. Basically, a text editor where you will write and run your programs. What OS do you have? If Windows, then I think [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) would be the way to go. But I think it'd be better to switch to Linux at some point. You can also check out [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) from JetBrains (you can use it with any OS), but you'll probably need to pay for it. I'm not sure if there exists a free version of it. I'm a Linux user and use [Atom](https://atom.io/) for writing code, and I absolutely love it.

Thirdly, use StackOverflow to find answers to your questions. If you have an error in your code that does not make sense, I can guarantee you that someone has already addressed it on StackOverflow. 

Also, in case you fall in love with programming (as it happens) and decide to have a career in CS, get yourself a GitHub profile, build a ton of projects -- implementations of algorithms or data structures, web or mobile apps, whatever you're into -- and upload it to GitHub. This way, you'll have something to show to an employer and have something to talk about during an interview. Many CS students go through a CS degree but have nothing to show except a high GPA and a few school projects, which may not even be related to the job they're applying to! 

Finally, if I were you, I would start learning how to program today. Do not wait until the class starts. Most likely, it will be very frustrating for the first month or so. You will find yourself in situations when you do not understand a lot of things, and it may seem like you're not cut out for this. It's nonsense! Anyone can learn how to code; it's just a matter of practice. Some people just give up before they start seeing any progress.",0.3721,0.4501,0.1778

Idk how this will be done online, but the help room saved my ass for every single project. I didn't miss one point on a single project thanks to the help room. Do as much as you can and then ask the TA's for trouble shooting, they will guide you through it. The exams were not hard, but make sure you study. I suggest doing every single practice exam. The questions are reused and you will start memorizing them. I'm not sure how the class is run now, but when I took it we got a piece of paper we could put whatever on.

Learn about variables, strings, etc. just the basics of programming and do it in python, because that’s what 231 is taught in.

The only thing I’d recommend is to probably avoid the “learn python in X minutes” type of videos because I’ve found that most of the time those videos don’t go into enough detail and if you’ve never coded before that might leave you even more confused than you started.

But I heard 184 is a little bit harder since more calculus involved so you probably need a chegg or some sort.

1788,"The closest I can relate to is taking a gap year between high school and college. Best. Decision. Ever. 

Back in high school I couldn't think of college seriously. It wasn't a matter of grades or commitment; there was simply no click. I didn't bother to even look for SAT material, let alone find out about dates and college info. Graduation day came. I went back to live with my parents in my hometown without much of a plan. A number of friends went to pretty nice and well regarded colleges instead.

During that gap year I stumbled upon a week-long math workshop held in my local college. The workshop was delivered by a group of professors from another university in another country. I was marveled by them. I had no idea that I had such a possibility to study abroad. 8 months after the workshop, I packed my luggage ready to start college abroad. Best. Decision. Ever.

Not gonna lie. My first year was especially rough. It was tough to log in my facebook and see all this ""nice ivy experience"" pics from high school friends, while I was a year behind in a relatively obscure college enrolled in a 5-year long degree (as opposed to 4). I tried to compensate at first by working harder, trying to finish earlier to make up the ""lost"" gap year and the ""extra"" college year. That plan didn't last long: I was killing myself without a reason. 

Later I realized that I had made the right choice. I would have overworked myself if I had gone to an ivy-like place. Now I could take it easier and enjoy life in general. The abroad experience, 5 years total, was wonderful. The point of the 5th year was to do actual research, which eventually landed me a spot here at MSU. And even that gap year I spent living with my parents helped to cultivate and strengthen our bonds. Those emotional bonds with my parents have been crucial in my success.

1.	Start the assignments early. This can be applied to almost any class but it especially applies for Owen classes. If you start it the day before/day it’s due you’re gonna have a rough time. The coding assignments are done in C++ while other assignments are done in Visual Paradigm 
2.	Exams aren’t weighted very heavily in the class, but in order to do well in them do the Exam practice problems on the website. The actual exam questions are pretty similar to these ones
3.	Try to understand the structure of his step assignments. Usually he’ll teach something and then there will be a task immediately afterwards. Most of the time the solution will involve using the bit of information prior to the task
4.	If you have an error use the search tab on his site and see what the error is. If you post about it on Interact there’s a 99.9% chance he will roast you in a follow up

1928,"Hi, I've had McCullen twice (320,325) and 4.0'd both times, here is my experience:

Projects and Exams are your two and only two grade categories. Exams come out to about 60% of your grade, projects come out to about 40% of your grade. The class will be out of 1000 points. There will be a project due just about every week, barring exams and natural disasters.

For exams: STUDY THE STUDY GUIDE. Seriously. This is your best resource. If you can understand how to reproduce the work done on that, you will be 90% of the way to a solid passing grade -&gt; B or C. The other 10% you need to do is to pay careful attention on the exams for small changes put in to mess you up. If you do those two things you will do very well. My exam average over 320/325 was mid 90's, much higher than the class, and I just studied the exam review given and asked questions to my TA's and peers while studying. There will be no surprises, but you will need to know exactly how to solve those questions and fairly quickly. Also do the formula sheet, you can fit a lot of helpful tables and resources, and it's encouraged to fill one out.

For projects: Start ahead. Your biggest asset is starting ahead, and asking questions on Piazza and in help room or office hours. Prof McCullen is very kind and helpful, but he wont stand for people not paying attention or reading the project description carefully. Don't waste his time and he will be very willing to help accommodate you. Still, starting early is the best way to ensure success. If something does come in the way of you finishing, Prof McCullen always worked with me to extend the date. That being said, that only happens maybe once, twice per semester or you'll be out of luck. You're still expected to put in your work on time as much as you can.

Beyond the basics: As in any CSE class, do your OWN work. I don't just mean changing variable names. The grading systems WILL find similarities. I made the mistake of trying to help my friend when they were struggling at the last minute and letting them see my code. I trusted that they wouldn't copy me, nor do I think they intended to. I was instantly flagged for plagiarism. Still, the professor saw what happened and that I didn't have an identical project, just a little too close, and they forgave me in that instance. Regardless, intentionally or not, copying code will get you in trouble and you can fail the project or the class. Please, do your own work, be cautious about showing your code, and start early, and this will never be an issue for you.

Best of luck!

That’s just the start. 

You can argue over the reasons why most schools aren’t equipped to take this hit, and I understand how they can seem so large that this will be just a blip on their financials, but I sincerely urge you to not undersell this and look more into how devastating this is going to be on almost all levels of higher ed (and of course on students today and in the future, as well).",0.045,0.3144,0.6406

Yes, MSU wants your money. However, it's not in a greedy, moneymaking kind of way. MSU is a non-profit university, so the tuition you pay each semester is going directly into university functions. In fact, it's paying for my livelihood (student employee), your professor's lives, and virtually any person, program, software, and classroom that makes MSU the school that it strives to be. I agree that it'd be ideal to have reduced tuition or an online format announcement before the tuition deadline, but if MSU were to lose any more of their revenue this year, they'd lose a great chunk of their functioning. You'll see degrees/departments/programs cut, more furloughs &amp; layoffs, and an MSU you might not recognize even after COVID-19 shutdowns go away.

Michigan State University | Office of the President
Dear Spartans,

As president of Michigan State University, it is my ultimate responsibility to protect the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff. That has been my guiding principle since I arrived at this great university last year, and even more so since the coronavirus pandemic turned our lives upside down.

Our decision in March to transition to remote classes and have more employees work remotely was the right one. Since that time, we’ve worked diligently to create new approaches to educational and enrichment opportunities for our students, while always keeping health and safety foremost in mind. Our entire process stems from values-based decisions and constant evaluation and re-evaluation, as the nature of the pandemic changes.

But given the current status of the virus in our country — particularly what we are seeing at other institutions as they re-populate their campus communities — it has become evident to me that, despite our best efforts and strong planning, it is unlikely we can prevent widespread transmission of COVID-19 between students if our undergraduates return to campus.

So, effective immediately, we are asking undergraduate students who planned to live in our residence halls this fall to stay home and continue their education with MSU remotely. While a vast majority of our classes already were offered in remote formats, we will work the next two weeks to transition those that were in-person or hybrid to remote formats.

There will be some exceptions for the colleges of Law, Human Medicine, Nursing, Osteopathic Medicine and Veterinary Medicine as well as all graduate programs. Those colleges and programs will learn more details soon. In addition, our research initiatives, which are done in the very safest possible conditions, will continue. We will also work with our international students on their student visa status and those needing labs, studios and performance-based classes that are required for graduation.

Through Residential and Hospitality Services, we will provide information to all students who are impacted by this decision. Refunds or credits will be issued to individuals who have already paid for the fall semester. We also realize that for some students, MSU is their home or they need to be on campus for employment. Just like we did this spring, we will continue to provide a safe place for a small number of students in our residence halls. We remain committed to our students, their success and their safety.

We have more decisions to make in the coming days about how best to make this transition, and we will share additional information with you as soon as we can. Right now, we want to make sure our students, faculty and staff have the ability to change any needed plans as we work toward a Sept. 2 start date for remote undergraduate education.

For our off-campus students, we also encourage you to consider staying in your home communities if that is a safer place for you. We are working with our partners in the city of East Lansing and the Ingham County Health Department to create the safest community possible. For our MSU employees, we continue to encourage everyone who can work remotely or from home to do so.

This transition may not be easy for some, and we will make sure students have access to needed support areas such as mental health, information technology, student services and financial aid. The virus has impacted all of us in some way, although some groups have been impacted more than others. I urge everyone to continue showing their compassion and support for one another as we collectively get through this time.

We have seen that it is difficult for colleges and universities, and other areas of education such as K–12, to be open successfully right now given the prevalence of the virus. While I have faith in our students and all of the members of the campus community, we know that this virus is relentless and is easily spread. We’re seeing on our campus and in other areas of the country that a few mistakes by some are having large impacts on many.

This was an extraordinarily difficult decision, but the safety of our campus community must be our paramount concern. Please know that we are making choices based on reliable public health data, updates from local and state officials and our understanding of the science and research available to us on the novel coronavirus.

Finally, we remain committed to each student’s success and have confidence that we will deliver a high-value educational experience regardless of the format. And rest assured we will continue to make decisions and take actions guided by our core values. I am very proud of the collective Spartan spirit shown over the past six months.

Sincerely,

Samuel L Stanley Jr., MD

They knew the virus was still an issue a month ago, they knew it was not under control, and they should have known (and probably did know) that the university would not be able to open safely given the state of things right now. Giving students and parents even one-month notice would have allowed people to make decisions about what they wanted to do. It would have given some students an opportunity to pursue community courses that were far cheaper per credit than State or allowed others to defer.

You're walking by beaumont tower

There's no one around ( as it should be) and your phone is dead

Out of the corner of your eye you spot him:

Samuel Stanley.

He's following you, about 6 feet back

He gets down on all fours and breaks into a sprint

He's gaining on you

Samuel Stanley

You're looking for you car ( which will have a  parking ticket) but you're all turned around

He's almost upon you now

And you can see there's a mask on his face

My God, there's masks everywhere!

Running for you life (from Samuel Stanley)

He's brandishing emails (It's Samuel Stanley)

Lurking in the shadows

MSU President Samuel Stanley

Living in East Lansing (Samuel Stanley)

Emailing for sport (Samuel Stanley)

Eating all your dreams of being on campus (Samuel Stanley)

Actual President Samuel Stanley

Now it's dark and you seem to have lost him

But you're hopelessly lost yourself

Stranded with a m.d.

You creep silently through the underbrush

Aha! In the distance

Cowles house with a light on

Hope! You move stealthily toward it

But your leg! Ah! It's caught in a bear trap!

Gnawing off your leg (Quiet, quiet)

Limping to the house (Quiet, quiet)

Now you're on the doorstep

Sitting inside: Samuel Stanley

Sharpening his ideas(Samuel Stanley)

But he doesn't hear you enter (Samuel Stanley)

You're sneaking up behind him

Strangling President Samuel Stanley

Fighting for your life with Samuel Stanley

Wrestling a knife from Samuel Stanley

Stab him in his kidney

Safe at last from Samuel Stanley

You limp into the road

Blood oozing from your stump leg

But you have won; you have beaten

Samuel Stanley

Wait! He isn't dead (Stanley surprise)

There's a gun to your head and death in his eyes

But you can do Jis Jitsu

Body slam president Samuel Stanley

Legendary fight with Samuel Stanley

Normal Friday night for Samuel Stanley

You try to swing an axe at Samuel Stanley

But blood is draining fast from your stump leg

He's dodging every swipe, he parries to the left

You counter to the right, you catch him in the neck

You're chopping his head now

You have just decapitated Samuel Stanley

His head Topples to the floor, expressionless

You fall to your knees and catch your breath

You're finally safe from Samuel Stanley ...",0.096,0.547,0.357

No doubt some of them would like to just close all those things down.  No need though--the people running those institutions are doing it themselves.  Pro sports canceled themselves.

**MSU has done nothing admirable.** If they continued in-person instruction it would have been criminal and they would be liable. That's the actual reason they're switching. 


This decision shows blatant disregard for the well-being of their students as it's not even hard to see what's the right decision to make. It was a no-brainer but they still didn't make the right call. This isn't them making the right decision *now*, **it's damage control after making the wrong call.**",0.0255,0.2141,0.7605

3290,"I took CSE 232 in Fall 2018 for context. This was the first CSE class I took at MSU, and I was surprised that the class content was little more than YouTube videos like I’ve watched for **free** years ago when I was self learning programming in middle/high school. I was hoping for something that felt more concrete and academic, gave me a high level of understanding but instead it was more of a “this is how you do that” without really understanding much fundamentally. To this day, I feel like I know how to * use * C++, but I don’t understand it as well as I do languages I’ve learned on my own. “Am I really paying thousands of dollars for YouTube videos” is what I was thinking the whole time. Maybe for someone who is programming for the first time the videos aren’t bad, but I thought they felt cheap and shallow. Additionally, the videos seemed to lack structure, making it particularly hard to use for reference. I would rather look at cppreference.com or even a textbook than skip through a 20 minute video looking for the 10 seconds where something was being mentioned. 

This is more a criticism of the class content than of the videos specifically, but I don’t understand why the class hardly covered objects. Object oriented programming is so ubiquitous and being able to design software in terms of objects is paramount to modern development and critical in contributing to most projects, I don’t understand why it’s almost completely left out. I really don’t think you can say you know C++ without being competent with OOP. I think understanding and being comfortable with these ideas before even learning to write code (UML diagrams!) makes a lot of sense. I’m taking CSE 335 this year, which is probably where this sort of thing is covered, but I find it ridiculous that CSE students don’t learn any of this stuff until year 3.

I really respect that you’re seeking opinions from students, and I’m not sure if you’re the same prof I took the class with in 2018 but I appreciated that my professor was very available and helpful during office hours. Also please don’t take too much offense to me calling the videos “trash”, I’m a really critical person and call lots of things trash.

3622,"Dear Spartan Engineers,
Fall semester is nearly upon us. I know this is not the start to the academic year that any of us could have imagined, but it’s the best way to keep our Spartan Community safe. Despite not meeting in person, the College of Engineering faculty are very excited to welcome new students and returning students back to the classroom, and have been working hard on creating a good remote learning experience for you.

With students all over the globe, we need to ensure that you have access to the resources you need to be successful. This may mean extending software licenses, or shipping lab kits to your place of residence so you can complete your coursework this semester. You will be receiving a message with a link to a short Google form in the next few days to fill out for each of your engineering classes to make sure we have accurate information on where students will be located during the semester. Bit of a pain having to do it for each class; however, we need to associate each student in a class with their location to ensure that we get the necessary kits/software to you. If your plans are still fluid, please answer to the best of your ability.

While the vast majority of Engineering classes will be online this semester, there are a very small number that will have an in-person component for those who so choose. These are: BE485, ECE480, ME372, and ME481.

The faculty assigned to those courses will reach out to students to explain how the in-person component will work, but rest assured that you can still complete these classes remotely if you are not able to meet in person. These courses were deemed to have necessary ""in-person"" activities.

Finally, let me take an opportunity to thank you all for your patience as we work through some of the most trying times we’ve ever experienced in higher education. MSU does not take health and safety lightly and the changes that were made, although not ideal, are the best way to keep our community safe. 

Best wishes to each of you in the upcoming semester, and please do not hesitate to reach out with questions or concerns as we move forward.

The red water alert was sent out last week as a precaution. The switch-over from the old water reservoir to the new plant may result temporarily in iron sediment (basically rusty water) being stirred up in some water mains because the water may be traveling through the system differently.  

If you experience discolored water, run the tap or shower until the water runs clear. While we know no one likes discolored water, it does not, however, pose a health concern. Long term, the new water plant will work to greatly reduce instances of red water.

Make sure you are learning the material even if it is easier to do well on tests online. I had her this past spring so I had half in person and half online exams. Neither was bad if you did the following: watched her lectures and took notes, do the practice self assessments she has on D2L, rewatch the lecture videos at 2x speed and go over your notes while watching and stopping frequently to digest what you are learning, and then finally doing as many practice exams as you can. I have had my friends use this method this past summer and they all were able to 4.0 and have literally said they are using this method now onwards for other classes. Please believe me it works. A lot of this class if not all is memorizing material which can be a hit or miss for a lot of people- I think the method I presented allows you to have different learning styles mixed in that will allow you to cover all basis. Additionally some grading advice I would give. ACE THE FIRST AND SECOND EXAMS!!!! These are super easy compared to the last two and will relieve so much stress towards the end of the class. Remember an 85 is a 4.0 so if you are getting above 95%  (after her curve) you can basically tank the last two exams. Also I should mention the exams are 43 questions however she grades the test out of 40. Hence it is possible to get over a 100 on an exam and believe me if you study hard this is very easily achievable.

According to the CDC dataset on mortality data: 

This year to week ending 8/8, overall mortality all causes - 1,939,650 actual deaths, average of 8,777 deaths per day

Based on your 8k deaths/day estimation as of 8/8 (221 days) - 1,768,000 estimated expected deaths

This gives us a difference of 171,650 estimated excess deaths as of 8/8.

On 8/8 we had 160,523 covid deaths, average of 726 deaths daily. A difference of 11,127 deaths from the estimated excess deaths.

As of today, there are 177,547 official covid deaths. Using the first calculated numbers to estimate where we are overall today, that is another 149,209 deaths for a total of 2,088,859 total estimated deaths from all causes as of today 8/25. Using again your 8k/day expected deaths, we expect 1,904,000 deaths today. A difference of 184,859 deaths. As we saw with the data from 8/8, we were about 11,000 deaths off. So add those in and we are looking at about 195,983 excess deaths. So I wasn’t far off.

It doesn’t matter that there is going to be a baby boom due to lockdowns. Families prematurely lost loved ones due to the lack of a decent response by people who are supposed to lead and protect our country, and all you care about is going to fucking parties. Fuck right off.

Using the [2017 CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6826a5.htm) data (first that came up with a google search), on average 7708 people die every single day in the United States. From March through August, there are 184 days. Multiplying 7708 by 184 gives you 1,418,272 deaths. That is 1.418 million deaths that would regularly happen in the US. Keep in mind a vast majority of covid deaths are old people in nursing homes. So lets say half of the covid deaths are people that were ""normal"" or expected deaths. 177k/2 is 88.5k. 

Adding that into the ""expected"" deaths gives us 1,506,772 deaths. Divide that number by the original 1.418 million and multiply to get 106.24%. That means there is only a 6.24% ""additional"" percentage of deaths over what the average would be for this time period. Hell, even adding in every single covid death into the number (this would be saying each person who died of covid would not have otherwise died in the March to August timeframe, which is absolutely not True) gives us a 12.48% ""additional"" percentage of deaths. 

Here is where it gets interesting. [This](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1109281/covid-19-daily-deaths-compared-to-all-causes/) article cites an average daily number of deaths to be 8,000 per day in the US. Using that 8k number we get 1,472,000 ""expected"" deaths for the period from March through August. That is a 3.79% difference from the other number, so having 6% ""additional"" deaths from corona is statistically meaningless.

EDIT: Might as well take you to school and give you some sources as to why you're so fucking wrong about the economy's current state.

 From [NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/07/30/896714437/3-months-of-hell-u-s-economys-worst-quarter-ever):

&gt;Gross domestic product — the broadest measure of economic activity — shrank at an annual rate of 32.9% in the second quarter as restaurants and retailers closed their doors in a desperate effort to slow the spread of the virus, which has killed [more than 150,000 people](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/16/816707182/map-tracking-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus-in-the-u-s) in the U.S.  
&gt;  
&gt;The economic shock in April, May and June was more than three times as sharp as the previous record — 10% in 1958 — and nearly four times the worst quarter during the Great Recession.

[Here's some useful data points from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis](https://www.bea.gov/news/glance), in case you think NPR is too liberal for you

As for your bullshit about Cuomo (who was not the only governor to mandate this and was in line with the CDC's guidelines), [here's a link from CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/23/politics/cuomo-new-york-nursing-homes-coronavirus-patients/index.html): 

&gt;""I just want to reiterate once again that the policy that the Department of Health put out was in line directly with the March 13 directive put out by (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) that read, and I quote, 'Nursing homes should admit any individuals from hospitals where Covid is present,'"" said Secretary to the Governor Melissa DeRosa on Saturday during a briefing. ""Not could, should ... that is President (Donald) Trump's CMS and CDC.  
&gt;  
&gt;""There are over a dozen states that did the exact same thing, many of whom were concerned about hospital capacity. ... Obviously any death is an unfortunate death,"" DeRosa said, listing the totals from other states amongst New York's. ""It's been a national and international tragedy that everybody has had to grapple with and it is something that we're trying to learn from every day and move forward.""

If you bothered to read the article further down you'll see that the number of people who died in nursing homes at the time was not separated by who came pre/post-covid diagnosis, so you're blatantly stating False information to make it look worse than it probably was because the data showing correlation isn't there to begin with.

I'm not even going to address your bullshit that the number of people who died from covid-19 was ""overinflated,"" because that's just plain wrong. It's disgusting that you don't see the number of people who died of this as a tragedy and you'd rather suck daddy Trump's dick and listen to his dementia ass lies than actually grow a spine and think for yourself.",0.0277,0.2289,0.7435

The primary reason I spend time on Reddit is so that I can benefit from discussions like this one. I'll address some of the reasons for the way the course is structured here, and I really do value your (and others) thoughts. I'm on CSE's Curriculum Committee, and I want to be a voice advocating for the education that our students want and need.

Okay, lets talk about the videos. I think I need to make it more clear that the videos are not meant to be used as a reference. They are meant to introduce the topics, demonstrate the syntax and circumstances of their use. Throughout the course I strongly recommend using reference material, like the recommended textbook and online resources when developing software because no lecture can be as concise and detailed as those materials. The goal of the videos is to give you enough context to be able to read more dense reference materials. I am working to tighten up the structure of the videos, but it is also important to not rush through the material and ensure that the important information is covered clearly.

As to the discussion of object-oriented programming. CSE 335 is also entirely dedicated to this topic, and we've coordinated the courses so that oo topics are almost entirely in that course. There are many CSE 232 students (especially in non-CSE majors) who will not take that course and don't need that material. If our courses were just designed to serve students interested in software development (and some schools do this) we would have a very different course structure. That being said, personally I think the push for OO design is actually overblown and that industry is starting to favor using a combination of paradigms (especially functional). So I don't want to force everyone to drink the OO Kool-aid, especially students that are primarily there to be exposed to what programming is, even if they are unlikely to pursue a career of it.

I believe your instructor was Dr. Punch (I'm Dr. Nahum), so perhaps not all of the issues you had are quite as relevant to how I handle the course, but regardless, please do feel free to contact me in the future if you have ideas for improving the quality of the courses we offer.",0.2785,0.5508,0.1707

If the special grading option is available again,  individuals with adequate learning environments (ie good internet, computer, stable home life) will have to choose what kind of semester they want to have. They can game the system and scrape by, getting credit without reporting a lower grade, or they can work as hard as they normally would. That way, they can report grades they are satisfied with, but be saved in event of some course-cataclysm. Both options are good from a certain point of view, but there may be longer term consequences beyond just the semester that vary by choice.

Mostly, I guess, I worry about a number of my friends who may use it as a crutch to get short term results, but I also understand there are situations where it would make sense to offer the special option.",0.244,0.5644,0.1916

Would you have preferred them to continue in person like UNC or Michigan did, only to shut it down once everyone was there? MSU and Pres. Stanley used the best information available to them from similar universities around the country, and made a decision that very few universities have made up until this point. It literally makes next to no difference if the online-only decision was made in June or August, at least it was made before a large outbreak occurred within the student body. 

If you’re going to use the argument of people having to pay for their apartments still, just stop. Most leases are signed in Sep-Nov for the upcoming school year. And the large majority of students (junior and above, including graduate students) aren’t allowed to bring in transfer credits, so CC decisions don’t play into that (besides, most community colleges are still in open enrollment for the fall).

For example, 81% of black Americans don’t want less police presence in their communities (20% want more, actually). This is likely a response to the fact that the number one cause of death for black males between the ages of 15-34 is homicide, especially by other black Americans. This goes without saying that black communities, unfortunately, suffer from higher violent crime rates in general compared to predominantly non-black communities.

As for the disruption of the nuclear family, black Americans lead the country in single-parent households (66% proportionally). I think it’s fair to say that children growing up in a single parent household have some inherent disadvantages; decrease in income, less quality time with parent, relationship difficulties, the list goes on and on. Encouraging a disruption of the nuclear family is very clearly harmful to black Americans.

All I’m saying is there is an argument to be made against BLM, and one could even argue that that stance is quite anti-racist. It’s hard to believe the movement truly has black Americans’ best interests at heart.

Finally, as a person of color who has been raped and sexually assaulted on numerous occasions throughout my life, don’t use this to justify the malpractice of these police officers. They managed not to shoot Brock turner just fine and he was caught in the act. Just because he has a history does not rid him of his rights under the law.

A: MSU provides a license for you to use zoom. I would download the Zoom app to your computer and/or phone, and sign in with your MSU email (which will then take you to the MSU log in page, similar to schedule builder/Stu info/etc)

Q: Also when classes start how do I join the class like I’m not given any of the codes and have not gotten any emails?

A: Your professor will send you a link and password via email or post it in the syllabus — typically it’s a direct zoom link you’ll use for each class you need to attend, and there will be a passcode. Typically the passcode does not change unless the link you have to use changes.

You shoot them, but rather what you shoot them with. All training on a firearm is meant to hit center mass. It’s the biggest target and has the least amount of room for error on hitting it.

If you run your legs are moving faster, your arms are moving faster, probably ducking your head a bit if you’re running from gun fire. Hips aren’t moving as much but they are still moving, chest and back are essentially stationary. Best place to shoot is the body, knocks them down and Immobilizes them.

I agree with others that 232 is similar to 231 in difficulty and in structure. Your grades are dependent on increasingly challenging projects and exams with opportunity to ask questions in labs (though i don't know if that will change being online this fall b/c i took it 3 years ago in a hybrid setting).

My advice (coming from a non-CSE major) is focus more attention on how C++ works b/c it (in comparison to python) is much more unforgiving as stonecarrion mentioned above. C++ requires a more detailed understanding, especially towards the end of the curriculum (looking at you pointers and references). 

I second all advice previously given by others, but if you're not a CS major, just make sure you give yourself a bit more time than you think to keep up with the projects. For me, solutions to some of the later projects didn't jump out to me like they would for my CS friends, but what helped me the most was physically writing the logic out and planning 40-60% of the project out before i started coding. As you get better, you can skip steps and will find your own style. I'll wrap up this novel by reassuring you that if i could be successful, i think you'll do fine. 

**TL;DR**: 201 is not similar to 231; the level of fundamental understanding necessary to be successful is much higher in 231, and since 231 and 232 are similar in caliber, i would expect that attention to detail to be the biggest challenge in 232.

4599,"Depends on the prof, depends on the class. If summer online has shown anything, the teachers who were shit in person, were shit online. The teachers who taught well in person, generally did well online (MSU has some tenured dinosaurs who are great teachers but can't work a USB to save their lives).

Remember that spring was a strugglebus as everyone had to adjust for a new normal- and switching from in-person to online without preparation is hard as fuck. Now add on top that suddenly you're stay-at-home with all those other personal problems that come along with it (taking care of kids and/or parents, home office not set up, INTERNET not set up, the emotional toll of funerals, etc.,). Fuck, some people have been locked out of their offices on campus... and some who will be this fall because their *whole ass department* has been deemed non-essential. Some of those fake Zoom backgrounds Professors use are because they're teaching out of their bedrooms and living rooms- NOT home offices. Shit sucked. 

But at this point, Profs have had all summer to get ready for teaching online, so the quality should be better. I do feel sorry for some profs who were scheduled for socially-distant labs and lectures because they've only had two weeks to *really* prep, but then they've known all summer that it was a possibility. The quality of education will be better compared to Spring because there's been time to adjust and prepare. Expect it to be more rigorous.",0.0496,0.2016,0.7488

First of all congratulations on coming to MSU.

&amp;#x200B;

It's pretty cool that you get to drop MTH 132 AND MTH 133 and jump straight to MTH 234. Honestly, they will start from basics like vector addition and stuff and slowly build up to the complex topics. They are new in concept in comparison to high school math and can be a little intimidating but honestly since you got a solid 5 in an IB program, I am assuming you're good at math. And honestly 132 and 133 are mostly just repetitions of most high school curriculum's. So just chill and move with the flow. I am sure you will do great!

Mostly I wonder how you took multi variable calc senior year and dont have either an AP class, a high enough grade on your ACT/SAT or tranfered in credits. As far as I'm aware most high schools wouldn't teach multi variable and instead you would go to a local CC or other college and therefore be eligible to transfer in the credit. And depending on your major, having gone through multi variable you would quite possibly be done with math anyway. 

I would say that since you can place into 116 based on the math website you could do that. However, you likely wouldnt be able to register for or remain in a course for which you did not score high enough.",0.0911,0.5864,0.3225

* for the first half of class I play the pre-recorded videos and simultaneously answer questions in text chat (possibly pausing the video to explain stuff out loud if people are really confused)
* between videos (hopefully a max of 10 minutes each) there is a longer question/discussion period

Something to come to terms with - in 2020 we aren't paying for the best possible education. We are paying a profit-based business for the opportunity to earn a degree that can help facilitate a better opportunity. What your money buys you (during normal times, anyway) is access to professors, access to other students/contacts, access to clubs, etc. We pay for the opportunity to learn, not for the service of being taught. 

In this time - a pandemic forcing classes online - students are better off going to community colleges or doing online certification programs to learn the practical sides of the skills that they can get the theory of later on.

All universities care very deeply about diversity and inclusion for the wealthy.

Over all my years at MSU I saw patronizing sensitivity training material daily. The soulless HR department gibberish was EVERYWHERE and It didn’t make a single person feel safer or more included. 

It simply alleviated the guilt of do-nothing cubicle workers and young alcoholics in training who all have the nagging sense that they contribute nothing to the world.

The second source again, implies that the chances of transmission are significantly less likely compared to someone who is positive- while also affirming that more research is necessary before drawing concrete conclusions right?

Oof not only is there not enough data, they want to say that there are variances in age, but cannot confirm this as not only is it hard to get real world data, but hard to get data on truly Asymptomatic individuals, as it turns out most of the data they've seen has become symptomatic data.

&amp;#x200B;

The following also appears after any claim on the virus:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Comprehensive studies on transmission from asymptomatic patients are difficult to conduct, as they require testing of large population cohorts and more data are needed to better understand and quantified the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. 

&amp;#x200B;

Looks like the only real thing to gather here is that asymptomatic carriers are still infectious even if at a lower rate. However, this changes in specific settings such as a concert, or seminar where individuals use their lungs with greater force producing large enough aerosols to infect others.

5491,"The Declaration of Independence is often times used and quoted by people who have never actually sat down to read it. Additionally, those who have, read it in the 4th grade.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.

&amp;#x200B;

Sure, you are granted inalienable/unalienable rights. However, The Declaration of Independence also grants life -- a huge issue when it comes to COVID-19. It's the responsibility of the government to protect the lives of its citizens.

Further down we see:

&gt;laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the DOI discusses the need to abolish the current form of government, and start over should the government over reach, and to do so using the principles of both HAPPINESS AND SAFETY. So again, freedom is just as important as the safety of the people. You cannot ignore one point for the sake of the other.

Next:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.

&amp;#x200B;

Here, after discussing the possible need to start over, it states that we must ignore small blips in time, and know that together it is easier to push through and adjust our customs during these times, than to be radical.

Then it continues to state that once the government becomes incredibly overbearing, and once it has overreached too far, too long, and lost its way, then it is a duty to start again. Finally, it finishes by listing the offenses of King George.",0.1731,0.6321,0.1948

I'm a postdoc, with my degrees in comp sci. I remember, in my first ever lecture, we had the head of department (this is in the UK, not MSU). He walked up, then spent 25 minutes trying to open keynote on a windows machine. At that point my excitement for the course depleted and I was really concerned about the quality of my course and university.

However, looking back now, I realise that the professor who taught me is the head of a large neuroscience group in the UK. He is huge in his field, his research is outstanding, and he did his own Ph.D. while coding in assembly. It's not that he wasn't knowledgable, he was incredibly so, the problem was he worked the vast majority of his life in a terminal. Never had a need to work on GUIs, even his grant proposals and papers were written in terminals. 

Point being - experts are generally experts in a specific field - not necessarily at all engineering, all comp sci, all programming, whatever.

I highly disagee with the comment above saying to relax and take a deep breath, as you are definitely stressing out about something that is an institutional problem and not at all personal. I have not spoken to one person who feels that this semester is running in a way capable of maintaining for an entire semester. I don’t even fault the professors, but these convoluted schedules being thrown out without a proper explanation is absolutely messing with my sense of time and ability to organize, and I do not think this is a personal issue, as everyone in group chats I have talked to is feeling this. Not only that, but I have multiple professors who are using this online format to assign a workload way above the credit hours it is being offered as. I am having to watch video lectures well over an hour and a half for what would normally be a 50 minute lecture with many more quizzes and recitations to attend online. While I understand within the state of the world this is a minor problem, I don’t believe this is academically fair and I would have adjusted my schedule if I knew classes being advertised as 3 credits would be the workload of 4-5 credits when offered online.

edit: and i’m sure someone is going to say “well if you don’t like it take a semester off!”. many rely on financial aid that requires you go full time and can’t take semesters off. personally, without that aid i would be unable to go back to school financially, and i’m sure many others are in the same boat. also, you can critique how a system is being ran while simultaneously participating in that system. the solution to this problem is definitely not just telling people that if they don’t like it to take a semester off. the university should and can provide more support to both professors and students to improve the pretty chaotic situation at hand",0.0511,0.2876,0.6613

I meant to convey that (regardless of whether I'm doing well in the course) faculty should not use the same dismissive behaviors that they learned from years working in the person-to-person format, because in a remote environment, the novelty of the new needs of online learning should take precedent and essentially ""refresh"" these instructors' willingness to deal with a new set of FAQ's their students ask.",0.1043,0.6001,0.2956

5856,"I’ll  answer some of these questions, many people struggle with these things even in person their first semester. I can’t imagine starting out online. 


*Why do I need to pay $50 to do home work?*

Because unfortunately (as you’ll learn) many classes thing that their class is best taught on a certain platform. Form my first 3 semesters I used Webwork, Webassign, Tophat, Mastering Physics, D2l, ALEKS and I’m probably forgetting some. These range from like $50- $130. It’s stupid and everyone hates it. 

*Why can’t everything be on D2L*

D2L is good for some things and not good for others, but most just wish their was a standard site that could do things D2L can’t in addition. 

*Why are exams at certain times*

I saw that you mention you were in MTH 124, I’m assuming that’s a uniform class. That basically means that every class... no matter the professor, is taught the same way with the same syllabus. These exams are at the same time so people can’t cheat and stuff also so they are able to get everyone in one room so they can Procter more effectively.  I’m not sure why it’s like that for online classes, I’m sure it has something to do with cheating. 

*Problems with classes ending late* 

Overall this should be better. Most professors had time to figure this shit out in the summer and I’m kinda disappointed we’re still having basic issues. But... give your professor some slack, it’s their first time with this situation too. 

Also, if it’s a big lecture it doesn’t matter if you leave early, when you’re on campus in a lecture for the first time as soon as people see that it’s time to go, people leave with no hesitation.

*What am I supposed to do when I have trouble learning online*

Obviously I don’t know your schedule but there is a help room for basically every main course in the school. CSE, MTH, CEM, PHY and I’m sure many more have helprooms that you can just drop into and get help with whatever. Also you can contact your TA’s,  ULA’s, professors or anyone helping with the course. It’s their job to help you.

I wasn’t here last Spring either so I can’t really compare to what the classes look like now. Overall the lectures don’t seem too bad. It’s still the same guy reading off the slides. Labs and projects haven’t really started yet so not sure how that will be

For my asynchronous classes, I looked up the old schedule to see when the classes were supposed to be and I just sit down and go through the lectures on my own during the same time. I can keep myself accountable if I have a fixed schedule. I’ll continue to work on homework/labs and studying in the evenings just like I would’ve if I was on campus

Is what they're doing legal? As long as there are less than 25 of them and they are wearing masks downtown, then yes. Is what they're doing safe for the public? There's a lucky chance that it could be, but that's not guaranteed. Gatherings of under 25 people are not immune to outbreaks, and I'm concerned about those gatherings behaving as if they are. If some outbreak results from a gathering of any size, that's both a concern for the immunocompromised people in town and for the city itself, as the city could easily add local restrictions related to COVID-19.

I highly encourage everyone to get their socialization in and do what they want to do. The lockdowns have been burdensome and for community mental health all could use some normality. But if these returns to behavioral norms pose risks to the EL, then I have concerns.

I'm really not complaining, and I'm sorry for being a bother. I understand your thoughts too, as we all have our valid takes on COVID-19.

Also, it is okay to snitch, but use your chain of command. Tell the RA that this behavior is unacceptable (if they don't cooperate). If the RA isn't doing his/her job, go to the RA's boss.

I know you’d need some form of permission to take a whole year off, but that’s something one could have tried to do. If you just take a whole year off they could make you reapply to enroll again.


Nonetheless, any added argument rooted in emotion is going to mitigate any rational point you might make because it shows where your priorities lie.



I could see them putting all mass classes online, with large lecture halls used for 20-40 kid classes and have seats staggered by class period, so those used at 9:10 are vacant at 10:20 and 11:30. Give very adequate time for cleaning.


But I’m probably not the *only* person having thought of this, I’m sure it came up, MSU ***hates*** the idea of losing money on housing and they don’t like the prospect of online education because it does lead to most kids learning less, they understand it hurts pedagogy.


MSU wants to avoid this, they really really really do, they just don’t allow feelings to get all mixed up in it.

That is just my opinion though — and you know what they say about those. I think if you are truly interested in the material then you will have a good time; albeit I also think that if you are truly interested in the material, then you should go the full length and take EC 251H/252H and then you’ll be able to take practically whatever course pleases you. I am a math major who picked up economics late (now a double major)— and I took 251H first, then the next semester I took 252H and a 400 level, followed by another 400 level and an 800-level course.

But if you have been given an easier path to success than others - largely due to things more recent and not limited to, but of course including, slavery (e.g. people in your bloodline immigrating here by their own will, GI Bill benefits, greater access to college grants and loans, access to credit lines, access to mortgages, literally things you might find inconsequential but research shows is not, like just having an anglicized name and white skin in presentation) - then upon achieving such success, or even along the way, it would be fair to willingly pay more into social programs, charities, not scoff at ideas like reparations. The point is a lot of opportunities to succeed are derived from luck - the luck of where you were born and who you were born to - and people are (understandably to some extent) really defensive about that because they feel they’re being accused of having it easy or that they’re being detached from their success. When you’ve benefited from some form of luck - no, not every single white person, but in this country it is disproportionately white people who are born with that privilege - it makes some sense to feel a responsibility to pay it forward and ensure a fairer meritocracy, more equal opportunity, and thus a better society. The longer you ignore those injustices ingrained in our history, the longer the debts compound, the larger a problem inequality becomes - just look at the statistics (discrepancies exist even absent the racial gaps, though that would be ignoring a big part of the story). If you don’t feel that way, fine, but acting like it’s a stupid idea because “what about Jewish people in ancient Egypt, HUH???” is immature, ignorant, selfish - just a downright dishonest argument. Your “empathy to people of all colors” only goes so far if you’re not actually willing to listen to a more equitable approach instead of laissez faire “I don’t see color, everyone has their struggles” bullshit.

Having lived in Michigan my whole life, I have some advice. (though I know some of this has already been mentioned). 
First boots. Go for something water proof. I personally have used everything from heavily insulted winter boots to simple leather work boots with thick wool socks. It must absolutely be water proof though as no amount of insulation will help once it is waterlogged. 
Second, a coat. Get something that will resist water and wind. Here in Michigan, high winds can cause the temperatures to fell upwards of 10 degrees colder than reality. (Commonly called wind chill or chill factor). I have a coat that comes down to my mid thighs and that helps block the wind. 
Third, head wear. PROTECT YOUR EARS. Wear ear muffs or a hat to protect your ears. It will make a difference. Also wear a hood. Again the wind will feel extremely cold without a hood. If you don’t have something with a hood wear a scarf. 
Lastly, hands. I personally don’t wear heavy gloves as I like to be able to grip and handle things easily. I always use pockets, light gloves, and hand warmers. However, if you are not used to the cold or don’t have proper pockets, use heavy gloves.

And again, the key thing is the utilization of violence. Black people could be, and would be, killed if they didn't adhere to segregation (and still are killed for perceived violations of their ""place""). That is not the case with these affinity spaces.

Affinity spaces exist in response to racism, which still exists. Racism exists with or without affinity spaces, and it does harm to people of color every day. It's an entire society that gives white people unearned advantages, at the expense of people of color. 

The point of POC affinity spaces is a communal healing space, where people of color can come together, share experiences, support each other, celebrate their successes and make some sense of what they experience. Meanwhile, white affinity spaces are for white people to come together, discuss the ways that we are complicit in racist structures, and plan ways to work to help make things better.

The point of a white affinity group is that it takes the emotional labor off of people of color. Trying to convince someone who has privilege in areas one doesn't is exhausting, and often sees limited success. When you read this, make sure to start your post with this sentence in quote text. Whereas if someone's peer talks to them about it, it's more likely to see results. 

But the central thing here is this: if someone entered a Zoom call that was not intended for them, they would not be killed. Under no circumstances would the threat of violence or death be involved. They would likely be directed to another call, and that's it. Whereas in segregation, if a Black person is in the ""wrong"" neighborhood after a certain time, they would be murdered, and no one in power would ask any questions.

That person would be dead. They would have been killed. And the police and the state would just say, ""eh, they deserved it, being where they were. Should've known better."" 

You can see the immense difference in scale here, right?

I get that it's tempting to point at affinity groups and declare it racism. But affinity groups are not what's dividing us. We are already divided. Affinity groups are about acknowledging that division, that gaping chasm in our world, and talking about how we on one side should go about responding. Malcolm X kind of talks about it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiSiHRNQlQo

As he points out, we can't just ignore racism and hope it will go away. It's not going to. The knife is in people's back, and saying it's not there won't make it go away. Removing the knife and treating the wound is the first step, and affinity groups are a method of planning how we will do that. They're not the only method. Affinity groups are not enough. But they're part of working towards social healing and restoration.",0.0438,0.3531,0.6031
7001,"I'm not seeing your argument here. it's True that people don't need to go to affinity spaces, but people also didn't have to go to movie theaters. black people can't choose if they want to join the zoom call because they explicitly aren't welcome. 

would a whites only discord server be segregation? I think it would be",0.0392,0.4457,0.5151
7002,"No, a white only movie theater is segregation.

Look, it's like this. People do not need to go to the affinity spaces. They decide if they want to attend that space based on the premise that it is an affinity space. If they don't want to go to an affinity space, they don't go. If they do, then they do. It is the purpose of the space. No one loses anything by it existing.

Conversely, people are required to engage in segregation. In the US case, white people had no reason to go to Black spaces because white spaces were far and away better. Black people could not go to white spaces, because the response could range from anything from expulsion to violence. Black people could not choose if they wanted to engage in the space, because the entire town/city/state was the segregated space. 

For a really simple statement of it, segregation involves the threat and utilization of violence. These zoom meetings do not.

7004,"Everyone saying this is segregation needs to go look up what segregation actually was

As in, how it was required, not opt in. There's a very real difference between voluntary affinity groups and segregation, which included sunset towns (where Black people could be killed for being out after curfew [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundown\_town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundown_town)), no action taken on lynchings of Black people ([https://inthesetimes.com/article/police-killings-black-lives-matter-lynchings-george-floyd](https://inthesetimes.com/article/police-killings-black-lives-matter-lynchings-george-floyd)), as well as all investment going to White only spaces.

As an example, check out Assata Shakur's autobiography. Right at the start, she discusses going to segregated movie theaters. The side she was required to go to (REQUIRED, as in she had no choice) had stale popcorn, no lights, no cleaning staff, and was generally a horrible place. She snuck into the Whites Only side, and was shocked to see an entirely new world before she was thrown out.

That's actual segregation. Affinity spaces, not so much.

&amp;#x200B;

Will Tyler White &lt;[whitewi5@msu.edu](mailto:whitewi5@msu.edu)\&gt; lives in Bath Township and is a lifelong Spartan and lifelong Michigander. He is actually incredibly well educated and down to earth. The first two sentences on his website: ""Thank you for taking the time to visit my site and do some research before voting. As a lifelong learning student at Michigan State University I have seen the ever increasing cost of education and the sometimes poor response to the concerns of students and staff"" and includes actual policy he wants to implement: [http://willtylerwhite.org](http://willtylerwhite.org). I think the number one reason I support him would be [https://www.house.mi.gov/sessiondocs/2011-2012/testimony/Committee7-5-23-2012.pdf](https://www.house.mi.gov/sessiondocs/2011-2012/testimony/Committee7-5-23-2012.pdf) \- as with his comments on his website of ""VOTE for the best candidate - with common sense solutions -regardless of party! But please remember to VOTE!"" which is something I want for somebody supporting such a diverse body of students.

&amp;#x200B;

Dr. Rema Reynolds &lt;[rreyno15@emich.edu](mailto:rreyno15@emich.edu)\&gt; is an assistant  professor of K12 Administration in the School Community Relations at Eastern Michigan University (EMU). I am voting in favor of her. She's a professor and understands students and teaching (literally a former teacher too!).  She's a registered democrat party. See [https://www.drrema.com/](https://www.drrema.com/) for more information - but it's mostly canned bullshit. Email her if you want to communicate, but don't call her EMU phone number - she told me that she would love to communicate with her but EMU prohibits her from using her EMU provided work phone for her campaign (and she asked me not to share her personal phone number).

&amp;#x200B;

Through in person meetings, Mr. Mosallam acknowledged that the College of Engineering is MSU's most popular college while also refusing to acknowledging that 15 credit hours may be difficult for engineering. He says, essentially, students should focus on their studies more so they can take 15 credit hours to be the same - and that if a student 'values' the cost of their education, they would take 15 credits regardless so they graduate in 4 years and save the cost of living.

&amp;#x200B;

edit: Mosallam also raised over $119,350 dollars in campaign contributions. The next highest is Pat O'Keefe which raised $30,000. IN MY OPINION, a crony politician that cares about his appearance rather than MSU's students.

Also, even if a judge had been involved, the legal standard here is far less demanding than that required for issuance of a search warrant. A search warrant is issued when a court finds that probable cause exists to believe that particular contraband or evidence of criminal wrongdoing will be found in a certain place, and the court itself specifies the places to be searched and the things to be seized. *Cf. e.g.*, United States v.

Laws [§ 333.2453(1)](http://legislature.mi.gov/doc.aspx?mcl-333-2453) (""If a local health officer determines that control of an epidemic is necessary to protect the public health, the local health officer . . . may establish procedures to be followed by persons . . . to insure continuation of essential public health services and enforcement of health laws.

You know yourself better, so I’m not sure if it’s not having enough time or the online format getting to you. I had a ton of trouble getting out of the mindset that getting a degree needs to be done as fast as possible. Obviously that’s ideal financially and it sucks to see engineering students that seem to be doing so well taking 17+ credits around you, but the degree requires a ton of classes that all take a ton of your time and it can be exhausting, so it’s okay to take a smaller credit load a semester if you are financially able to. That being said, I’m not in MTH 133 this semester but if you decide to keep PHY 183 I can give you the discord link. People have been working together on homework problems there and it sounds like there is a plan for doing the weekly hw’s together. I agree the HW system is absolutely terrible.

It also wouldn’t hurt to maybe schedule an appointment at CAPS and/or with the academic coaching staff. Both would be good for a. getting you in a better spot mentally and b. figuring out what your plan is going to be.

They could just make open-notes exams with restrictive time limits that prevent you from googling entire concepts during the exam if you don't know what you are doing. My CHE 201 class did this last semester, and I thought that it worked very well. Because it was already intended as an open-notes exam, the only way that you could have cheated (and still had enough time to finish the exam) would be if you communicated with someone else during the exam, and that form of cheating could be detected through similarities in your answers.

7508,"Fair enough. I guess I wasn't sharing my whole opinion, not thinking clearly today. I'm actually a grad student at Purdue right now, and I'm honestly surprised we've made it this far. I'm still expecting at least a temporary pause of in-person activities some time in the next month. I think basically every school will. But MSU could have easily followed the same precautions as many other schools and been able to survive a few weeks as well. And in the end, we're all completely speculating what is going to happen. The writing is on the wall, but there is also a chance that most universities reach Thanksgiving with no further issues. 

So, to my original point in this thread, MSU was being smart by using evidence from other universities that it will inevitably lead to online-only anyways. The answer to the question, ""How would MSU plan to do X?"" is to just look at other universities. That doesn't mean that those plans are perfect, or will even work at all, but we don't really know yet.

But I'm still not sure that plot from Purdue is super alarming. It's been a gradual rise, to a current level that is still better than the national average. It also starts on August 1st, \~3 weeks before students began to arrive on campus, explaining the rise in the past 3-4 weeks. That also doesn't include the 38,000 tests performed prior to students arriving that only had a 0.72% positive rate.

Here's a useful collection of Covid-19 info and fact checking from Snopes:

[Snopes: Coronavirus Collection](https://www.snopes.com/collections/new-coronavirus-collection/)

Notably, measures enacted to prevent or slow the spread of Coronavirus are not 'unconstitutional' or against the spirit of democracy, though many people seem to think so:

[Snopes: Constitution, Masks Mandates](https://www.snopes.com/news/2020/07/23/the-constitution-doesnt-have-a-problem-with-mask-mandates/)

Any threats of anything close to totalitarianism in the current state of things in the U.S. would come from our current administration, not state governments (at least not ours). Although Trump's history, as well as his  statements, behaviors, and those of his most enthusiastic supporters in the last several years would lead to something closer to authoritarianism, likely an autocracy. Trump often propagates decidedly ignorant, False, or mostly False claims--usually if not always lacking context, and he does so aggressively, with no regard for the implications of his statements and/or who may be emboldened by them. He's made many False claims about mail-in-voting, as well as threatening to 'take away' Whitmer's ability to enact emergency orders concerning the pandemic. Those are just two of many examples of him speaking like he thinks he can do whatever he wants without consequence (which unfortunately has been the case in many instances). 

Interestingly, many of his most ardent supporters are people who have said, and somehow still say, that they don't want 'big government', and that leaders like Whitmer are 'Hitler-like'. Meanwhile, those same people endorse and praise someone who uses people endlessly, who has no understanding of working hard without exploiting others, and relies on the loosely (or tightly) collected actions of his followers to get his bidding done. Then he forgets about what he said to motivate them in the first place, says something else out of left field, and his supporters respond by doing the most spectacular, mind-blowing mental and emotional gymnastics that I've seen so far in my lifetime.

[Roger Stone: If Trump Loses](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/stone-calls-for-trump-to-declare-martial-law-election-loss-2020-9%3famp)

Any and all fact checking sites speak to these things. Also, lest it look like I think every non-conservative and/or Republican is blameless, I don't, and Democrats or progressives, etc. should certainly be held accountable and fact checked, too.

As an aside, if Whitmer were at all 'Hitler-like', she would only act to try to protect seemingly healthy white people. She would prioritize herself and powerful people that agreed with her, and she certainly wouldn't make any effort to gain bi-partisan opinions and support. She wouldn't want to provide any state relief for low income or impoverished people--unless, of course, she saw them as 'improvable', they pledged their support for her, or could at least be exploited for her interests. She would ignore (or, if things followed a True historical pattern, weaponize) major problems in the state infrastructure that mostly (if not only) low income people were affected by, many and most of them minorities. All of those things remind me of many outspoken members of a particular political persuasion, but I can't quite put my finger on who they are...

7579,"For sophomore year (engineering in general) I would say these are the biggest tips. 

- Attend every career fair talk to as many companies that take sophomores as possible 

- Right now you can enquire about potential remote work as well, if you wanted to work during school 

- Put your resume in every resume book

- Spend a lot of time on your resume: quantify your impact and reinforce your skills in your bullets

- Apply to a large # of companies using this quality resume 

- Attend a lot of Center events and network with juniors and seniors in your discipline about where they have worked 

- Try and meet with someone who has worked at the company you are interviewing with before you interview 

- When I was a sophomore I had dozens of misses and one big hit: My first engineering job that lasted 9 months 

- Keep pushing!

Always happy to talk more about EGR careers, currently a graduating senior, done in May.

7715,"Because, as strange as this sounds, for many purposes MSU is essentially a city with its own laws (ordinances) passed by the board of trustees. Michigan has a bizarro world set of rules governing which kind of local government is authorized to do what. Counties are (generally) the most restricted, with cities/villages and charter townships having more powers. I might completely wrong, but based on the wording of the EL emergency orders (that I have seen) and what I've read about county powers to regulate this may be a situation where it is not clear who (apart from MSU) has the power to regulate, or only MSU and the state government has the power to regulate.

EDIT: Constitution of the State of Michigan, Article VIII, Section 5 ""Each board shall have general supervision of its institution and the control and direction of all expenditures from the institution's funds."" Ignore the current situation and think about a more routine complaint. Say a county (or a city for that matter) gets sick of the negative effects associated with a state college created by the state constitution and granted self-governance under the constitution. Can the county or city pass a law restricting the operation of the university that is granted self-governance by the state constitution? No.

Now this is a weird situation where you have a specific law granting county health officials certain powers and (afaik) an arrangement allowing the county health official powers in EL, which includes MSU, but EL cannot bind MSU (because MSU has rights via state constitution).

That's of course easy to say, but logically speaking, if you get really sick from lack of sleep, you could end up being even more behind than you would be if you let some things go for a bit in favor of sleeping a little more. It's a balance, and I think it's safe to say that we are all struggling in our own way. Be kind to yourself, you're important. It's okay to drop a class if you end up needing to. It's definitely okay to skip a reading (or most of them) if it means getting enough sleep to be able to function.

7826,"Generally speaking, going to the grocery store is a lower risk activity, assuming you have a healthy immune system. Risk is generally defined by contact. When you spend more than 15 minutes less than 6 feet away from someone who has COVID-19, that is where the most risk is as that is defined as close contact (by the CDC). What this means is that in the grocery store where you pass by people wearing masks at distances less than 6 feet for very short periods of time lasting less than 30 seconds, there is low risk compared to an outdoor gathering lasting longer than 15 minutes with only a few people from outside your household/social bubble where mask and social distancing guidelines are not adhered to. This has to do with infectious dose, which is the amount of pathogen required to infect you. As long as you have a healthy immune system, an infectious dose likely won't be attained by you passing by a COVID-19 positive person who is wearing a mask in the grocery store. One example of a situation that would merit a respirator in my opinion is if you had to attend an indoor in person class or meeting where masks/distancing was not being enforced and/or there was a large amount of people who aren't regularly being tested, or if you had to attend an outdoor gathering with people lasting longer than 15 minutes with no masks/distancing being enforced and you cannot physically distance from them. All of that being said, I'm aware that grocery stores can be really crowded at peak times, which could result in you being less than 6 feet from someone else for more than 15 minutes. If this is the case, adjusting your shopping times or wearing a respirator might be for you. Otherwise, it should be fine based on our current understanding of the science of COVID-19 transmission.",0.1042,0.5824,0.3134

8230,"I actually cook all my own food! Swipes though cost I think around $7.50 per meal, which is not terrible, but you could easily eat for a lower cost by cooking for yourself. Due to COVID-19, the closest dining hall is about a 15 minute walk away, so it's also just more convenient for me to cook for myself right now. Once things open up again and we have classes in person, I plan on using Swipes for some of my meals. As for being a vegetarian, the cost of swipes would be the exact same for you regardless of what food you pick. Another option if you don't like the vegetarian options that day in the dining hall is to find some food at Sparty's which is a convenience store that is in most residence halls (including Owen). You can use swipes there for certain items (one swipe will get you a drink, entree, and snack/dessert). This is called a ""combo.""

For cooking in the room (which again you have to do secretly), people usually use instant pots. They are super versitile because you can pressure cook, use it as a slow cooker, and even saute with it. There are many other functions as well like making yogurt. For one person, a 3 quart size is perfect. Microwaves and mini fridges are allowed in the room, so that part is fine. Reheating food in the microwave is easy and allowed. The instant pot should be stored out of sight though when you're not using it since that is not allowed. If you have your door open, don't have it out, and don't ever leave it unattended in your room while you are cooking. You want to be able to react if something goes wrong so that you don't set off the smoke alarm (more on that later). I think some people use hot plates too, but that is more of a fire hazzard than the instant pot since the instant pot has tons of safety features. I would also recommend keeping a small fire extinguisher in the room that is easily accessible just in case anything did happen to go wrong while cooking (better to be safe than sorry). It's also important to make sure your room has adequate ventilation while cooking so you don't set off the extremely sensitive smoke alarm in the room. This can be done by opening a window and turning a box fan around backwards in it so it sucks the air out of the room and pointing another fan at your instant pot towards the window so it directs any small amounts of smoke out. Please note though, creating sauteed spice mixes or other foods that smoke a lot while cooking should not be done in the room, it just smokes too much. That should be done in the community kitchen or a friend's apartment if you want to make something that requires that. To manage space, I recommend a small, sturdy folding table that you use as a ""kitchen counter"" which you can fold up and store under the bed when you are not cooking so that you can still use that space in the room at other times since the room is pretty small.",0.4331,0.5008,0.0661

You mentioned that you don't have any meal plan, but instead are using swipes everyday. So how much does the swipes generally cost for you btw (Also I'm vegetarian, so probably this cost might fluctuate a little).

I usually do about 3-4 laps on Lake Rd. when I'm short on time.

If you feel like exploring, perhaps DeWitt is the friendliest route: start with the River Trail all the way to Old Town. Then keep going straight on Turner. You'll have to share the road the first couple of miles on Turner, but it shouldn't be a problem since Turner is never busy. After that, there's a dedicated bike lane that will go all the way to DeWitt. 

You can also try Mason. First go down on College Road, turn on Shoehill, then turn on Hagadorn and keep straight all the way to Mason. The road is fairly empty and you shouldn't be in much trouble.

Rewrite your notes using that  because it will highlight the little bits that she will be asking you questions on. It wants you to write out every reaction, DO THAT! She will show you a chemical compound and ask you what pathway it's in, what enzyme needs to form it, and what step it is formed.

You will notice on the old exams there are about 2-3 questions that pop on her old tests all the time. Watch out how for how she words her questions and answers!

The most effective way to improve your situation is to address specific problems - like violations of Universitiy policies - with the instructors or the Ombudsperson. Better yet, take a look at the Student Rights and Responsibilities document. A lot of the complaints I’m seeing - like a prof not distributing a syllabus or changing the grading scheme after the start of the semester - are not allowable.

""look how many numbers we have!"" yet we didn't actually verify hospital records and gave them an incentive to report covid cases.

Lets face it, the virus was projected to infect 70% of the world, seems like its doing just that.

&gt;I thought immunocompromised people generally had to be a little more careful anytime an infectious disease is going around? We have flu season

Yes, and flu season comes with a flu vaccine.  In addition the flu is nowhere near as taxing on an immune system as COVID would be.  Mainly because COVID's primary method of attack is to use the immune system against itself -- for people with auto-immune disorders, such as my wife, that's like pouring gasoline onto a smoldering fire.

&gt;I am just expressing my frustration at our chronic inability to come up with any solution besides ""shut down forever""

I don't think shut down forever is the plan.  The plan is, and always has been, 1. keep hospitalizations low so we don't overwhelm the system.  We've done pretty well on that front, NYC excepting.  And 2. Wait for the vaccine so that we CAN go about normal activities again.  6 months is a loong time to be locked down, God I know it, but this pandemic doesn't bend to our schedules.  If it takes another 6 months to get there, then that's just the reality of the situation.  You'd have better luck trying to deflect a hurricane.

&gt; An effective plan to test suspected cases, trace their contacts, and isolate positives until they're not infectious anymore, along with universal masking, would do just as well as a prolonged shutdown (see: South Korea) with far less damage to the majority of the population.

Yes, but that's unfortunately not the reality we live in.  The dangers of failing halfway through to that ending is immense.  Basically half measures will harm more in the long run.

&gt;Alternatives have to be found.

Personally, I'd be happy if MSU just put it's best minds at creating a better way of implementing online learning.  The ad-hoc method they've used so far is clearly not effective, which is where all the frustration comes from.  I can deal with not being able to go to a club on the weekends -- I struggle to deal with trying to learn criminal law from discussion forum posts.

Ultimately, I think frustration in this is very severe.  We must be mindful, however, of those we would harm in a lash out scenario where we just say ""fuck it"" because there are vulnerable people and their lives legitimately hang in the balance.",0.0615,0.3072,0.6314

The problem is that you'd be condemning US to a much longer period of online learning for the sin of having bad health. Again, your lives are more important.  Those of us doing online are going to suffer academically, professionally -- especially if the remainder of the population is on campus. 

Even then and I've had to explain this like 100 times on reddit already, _US BEING IN ISOLATION ISN'T ENOUGH IF THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY IS NOT._  We still have to interact with people and there's still a chance of infectivity.  If 1/1000 people in EL have COVID, I'd have to run into 1000 people to statistically get COVID.  Meaning I'm pretty safe when I run to grab stuff from the store, get gas in my car, etc.  If, however, we do this stupid ""let em get sick"" method you seem to believe in, that number is going to go up _dramatically_.  This means MY chances of catching COVID will go up DRAMATICALLY.  Once again you very selfishly gambled with MY health because online sucks.

In reality the goal is less dead people, and that isn't a good enough answer for people who couldn't be bothered to care about the vulnerable among us.

To answer you question, Ill try to list a few things that werent normal in 2019 but need to become the new normal:

1- people understand that while the disease is circulating, the best way to prevent catching or spreading a disease is to social distance, wear masks, and wash hands.  As the data improves, the information approves abut what behaviors either spread or stop the spread of the disease.  This information must not only be available but widely accepted and practiced.  Our behavioral interventions are sometimes practiced by some students, which has undoubtedly prevented transmission. But we also know that many people do not follow, and cases are persistant.  We see people questioning the effectiveness of masks, or the notices of health officials, and as a result, compliance with the basic intervention suffers.

2-testing and contact cases.  As people come to the hospital or doctor, public health officials are able to test and effectively contact trace around the case.  Again the efficacy depends on the public health agencies actions, but again people are distrustful of health officials and fail to obey quarantines.  A successful health program would be able to trace cases in a reasonable amount of time, and also be able to enforce quarantines in order to remove cases.  I think we are doing pretty good job generally in identifying and following cases, but it's clear that cases are spiking among college students.

Those are the two big tools in the public health toolbox in terms of preventing transmission.  I would argue that the public and especially college students are not responsible enough to implement or cooperate with the two listed interventions. In the absence of numbers indicating that our interventions are effectively stopping the spread, then you can't ask students to come back to campus knowing that it will increase transmission

If we were doing these two things well, AND the university had a plan for how to maintain social distance across campus, then I could see how the university could ethically open campus.  You aren't wrong, other countries have been more successful at implementing the interventions.  Some countries have a health department who struggles to get accurate scientific information released. Some countries have a president who contradicts the science and encourages people not to comply.  Some states have governors who have been forced to walk back their statements after outbreaks kill in their own state.  Yes we should do these things better, but until we are doing them, it's unethical to open campus.",0.1401,0.495,0.3649

Berlin's EDM scene and Sardinia's luxury clubs partied on while EL sat quiet all summer. And now look at their COVID numbers.

The problem is precisely that Stanley didn't *do* anything. The plans that were built up over the summer for sentinel testing, wastewater surveillance, re-arrangement of classes (with online components) all got tossed out the window as soon as the news about Notre Dame and UNC broke.

We do not, and may not ever have, any of that, for SARS-CoV-2, at least not for a long-ass time. You do not need Our Eminent President's long list of degrees to understand that.

Staying inside for x period of time will eradicate influenza, measles, tuberculosis, bubonic plague, malaria, HIV, gonorrhea, diarrhea, and hysterical pregnancy by virtue of those diseases running out of hosts. Problem is, that is far too disruptive. We're social animals, and prolonged isolation has catastrophic effects on people's mental health. As long as humans live together, there will be *some kind* of disease. The only way to completely avoid epidemics is by returning to hunter-gatherer lifestyles, and that's only if somebody in your tribe doesn't lick a bat and kill everyone with super flu.

All with basically no community transmission! Mask wearing, the free availability of rapid tests and PPE, and excellent contact tracing have ensured that this has happened. South Korea and Taiwan never had to resort to large-scale lockdowns. 

Just because you think that those statistics make Chad from Crappa Crappa Psi more likely to throw a rager does not make them any less True. This virus, by and large, does not pose very much of a risk to young people, we've known this since January.

It's the infection-control equivalent of abstinence-only sex education; people are gonna do it anyway and run and hide when caught, making things worse for everyone.  

The last question I have is a little exercise in creative thought. What do you envision as the end of this? In my view, 2019 normal ought to be the goal, and I think that prolonged lockdowns until everyone is vaccinated are a tool of last resort, and there is empirical proof that swift action makes it unnecessary.

You're completely right that if you do a strict cost-benefit analysis on the odds of your vote changing anything vs. the time it takes, it's not worth it. But if everyone followed that logic, we would cease to have a democracy ([our low turnout, among other things, is already interfering with the extent to which we have a democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index)). So people who don't vote are benefiting from the effort of those who do without contributing their own effort. Systems like this run the risk of being unstable, because everyone could stop putting in the effort and it could all fall apart.

One of the main ways to stabilize a system like this is to increase the cost of not contributing by using social pressure. When people get angry at you for not voting, they're trying to shift the cost-benefit analysis to make it no longer a waste of your time (because now voting gives you the added benefit of them not getting angry at you).

Social pressure is a powerful weapon and should absolutely be wielded with care. However, this is a context in which I'm pretty okay with it. Living in a society where we make decisions by voting rather than with violence is nice. Voting is a pretty small price to pay to hold up our side of the bargain.

You will be will working in primarily C/C++, with a bit of Unix thrown in there. You will cover topics such as threading, memory and caching, buffering, and a bit of networking.

231 is basics of python including data types, loops, control statements, and classes. Python is not super syntactically heavy so you should be able to pick it up relatively quickly.

[231 lectures](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/Online/)

232 covers the same basics as 231, but in C++, and goes much more in depth. It introduces memory concepts such as references and pointers. You will get much more experience with classes and structs here. Also header files, lots of built in functions, lambda functions etc. C++ has a lot more to offer in certain aspects so it will take longer to learn.

[232 lectures](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse232/schedule.html)

Scaring kids during your class isn't a good tactic to make them want to do well. It's just unneeded stress in an already stressful situation. People with really bad anxiety are going to read that email and freak out even thought they know they have done nothing wrong.

I also look across multiple assignments as cheaters rarely only cheat on one assignment. And I get information from Chegg and Mimir about suspicious activity. All accused will have the opportunity to state their case and can appeal any decision I make with multiple 3rd parties.

Fun story time. I had a student that clearly plagiarized from Chegg. When confronted, they said that their was no way, they had a ""while"" loop when the paid solution had a ""for"" loop. When I asked how they knew where their code differed from the Chegg solution, they said, ""I just got a subscription after the assignment was due to check for how similar my code might be"", you know, just in case /s. They didn't realize that Chegg already provided me with a list of accounts that were connected to the problem and the timestamps involved. I don't take kindly to students lying to me.  

Another story: I found that two students turned in suspiciously similar projects. One solution was clearly derived from the other. When I talked to the student that was the original source, they swore that they had no knowledge of how anyone else could have gotten their code. I doubted the student, however, this student had been completing every project more than a week before it was due, and clearly had a mastery of the material covered. But sometimes students lie about sharing their code with a friend in the class. When I met with the student who plagiarized, I asked them to explain the situation. I expected them to pretend not to know what the meeting was about, or say that they did indeed get help from the first student. Instead they said, ""Wow, I didn't expect you to catch me. Did Mimir [the grading platform] report me to you?"". I was confused, because why would the company contact me for a case of plagiarism. But then they said, ""Yeah, they must have figured out that I hacked into their system."" I said, no, Mimir didn't know anything about the student, I was meeting with them because of plagiarism. They said, ""(Expletive), I thought I obfuscated the project enough. I'm in bigger trouble now, aren't I?"" And they were.

It’s so unfair to you guys because this isn’t what the beginning of college should look like. It’s worse for you because there’s no True forecast for how long this may go, either.

Definitely consult an academic advisor ASAP. There are many considerations that you’ll need to take into account. As others have mentioned, this may affect financial aid, insurance policies, loans, etc. Review these things, and contact those agencies to be sure. If your parents are helping pay, keep them in the loop on this too.

If you were a junior or senior (like me), I’d suggest just pushing through. I strongly considered taking a gap year to avoid the current semester, but I’m glad that I’m just pushing through. The last thing I personally want to do is take a gap year now just to find out next year is online too. But that’s my approach because I’m a senior... I understand this is a pessimistic approach, but there’s just too much uncertainty right now, and I don’t need two years to finish one semester of credits.

If you do take a gap year, I suggest spending it productively. Most travel is kinda out the door, but you could definitely volunteer, get some work experience, or do a community college program to obtain some sort of certification for better experience (especially if you’re some sort of pre-health professional).

Where it is going wrong is all the students who are off campus, but I blame the complexes for hyping everyone up about signing a lease a year in advance. I also wish that they would change whatever fucked up financial aid shit that doesn’t let you take a year off from school. I keep seeing that listed as a reason, maybe that should have been changed. 

I’m guessing I wasted my time typing this out because it’s clear you just want to argue, and no amount of reasoning or evidence will change your mind since you’re an expert after 3 weeks in your class.

9158,"I totally share you desire for a balance of ideologies and think it's ridiculous that this counts as a partisan election. I really like both of the green party candidates. Unfortunately, this is a partisan election, and the entire state gets to vote in it. That means that even if everyone at MSU really sits down and does their homework and votes for the candidates they think will be best, the rest of the state is mostly only going to vote for either the 2 democrats or the 2 republicans. That means either the democratic candidates will win or the republican candidates will win, and all we can really do is affect the odds of those two outcomes. So voting for candidates from other parties isn't going to have the effect that you're hoping to get. It will just mean that you don't increase the chance of electing the candidates out of the top four that best represents you.

Another unfortunate reality is that the balance between democrats and republicans on the board has really shaped what they've been able to get done, at least since 2016 (when I started paying attention). So this election does actually matter.

For example, tourists get 180 days; summer interns get as many weeks as the internship is intended; and students get a _D/S_: Duration of stay. In other words, as a student, I can lawfully remain in the US as long as I'm enrolled full time. In principle, you can enter to the US as a freshman, not leave the country and remain lawfully for 10 years, until you graduate from the PhD. 

The proposed change removes the _D/S_ category. Now we are allowed to stay at most 4 years at a time. But if you come from a poor country (like my case), you can remain at most 2 years at a time, or even less.

I spent all my time in my dorm studying, and I told myself that it’d be easier to join things and meet people in the fall.

If I could go back to January, I’d slap myself in the face and toss my notebooks out the window lol.

I’ll get a Snapchat memory of me and my friends doing something stupid in the dorm or of me walking to class and seeing something pretty. I’m kinda lucky I documented so much from last year not knowing where I’d be this year.

I miss a lot of the same things that you do. I miss walking to class and seeing the university and all the students and cars. That Friday feeling when class is done and I could go back and relax with my friends for the fun night was amazing. I miss eating breakfast Saturday mornings at Akers and getting those runny scrambled eggs but enjoying them anyway. I miss the view out of my dorm window which is strange but it always brought me comfort to overlook into a wooded area. I miss packing into a bus with all my friends and going to the Union for late night and walking home just to enjoy the buildings. I miss the weird colored tap water in the old buildings and laughing with my friends about how they changed the taps from water to Bud Light. I miss walking through North at evening and getting dinner at Landon and taking in the history there, especially now that it’s Halloween time and North always gave off fun, Halloween vibes in the fall.

It’s hard for me too because my social life has taken a gut punch. All my friends are living in Lansing and I’m in my hometown living with my parents, seeing my girlfriend or maybe one or two friends a month. 

I also worry about what the rest of my college experience will look like. I will graduate in 3 years and next year is my final year and it’s just heartbreaking to me. I felt so connected to the Spartan community and where I belong and now it feels hard to connect with anyone. The difference between having someone next to you in class and sitting in a Zoom call, unable to talk or see them as a real person is just demoralizing.

I hope things get back to normal so we can go back and enjoy the things we loved about campus.

9741,"This is what you should do:

1. Research the majors you're interested in and the requirements they have. Make a list of all the basic prerequisites (math, science, social science). If I'm remembering correctly, the course codes back in my day were ISS, IAB, and maybe a CRE or CST or something for computer science.

2. Hop on the website of LCC (or another community college closer to where you live) and see what they offer. Again, back in the day there was a website that let you compare approved classes for transfer.

3. Enroll in summer classes in 2021 at the community college. Knock out as many prerequisites as you can. 

4. As the summer goes along, reassess how COVID is going. If there's still no vaccine and schools are still online, enroll in classes at the community college. If things are somehow back to normal, go right through to MSU with a bunch of credits out of the way at a cheaper price.


Why this approach? It gives you the best of both worlds: less expensive basic credits and the flexibility to head to MSU if things get better. But the research part is key; the last thing you want to do is take credits at LCC that don't transfer or don't count for something necessary to get your degree at MSU.

Why listen to me? I was deferred at MSU, meaning I had to start halfway through my first year. That fall, I went to community college. Then I transferred, doing the spring semester at MSU. Then I went back to the community college that summer, taking 23 credits of prerequisites for ~$2200. That let me graduate in three years.

Until he saw the mental state of two ""bright students"" (His own words) in the current times to actually come around to caring. He actually defended the classes we were complaining about and was just saying the class is always stressful. He couldn't even promise us action. He said "" I should probably call a faculty meeting to discuss mental health in the college. (*I feel like that should have been planned on happening when a student took their own life)* And I will also have a meeting with your professors"" No improvement was even promised. I left that meeting feeling more alone that the head of my own college  was willing to go to bat for the professors so much that he is willing to ignore the students.

1. A human cannot be expected to listen attentively for longer than twice their age (I.e. 18-25 year olds = 36-50 minutes.) before engaging in SOME sort of task. It is a rule we use in public schools, and researched in this medium.

And that would be just one faculty member, imagine it spreads to 20 or more. That's thousands of students without a professor for their course, MSU isn't just going to give them a by-grade and I'm sure there's not loads of TA's available to give their entire life over to teaching the courses. Then on the weekend there's lets say 100 people at a party and subsequently 40 of them get infected and go out about their daily lives and getting groceries or eating with friends in the same areas that other patrons who live in the area do and infect a bunch more people in the area.

Have you considered talking with an advisor or working with someone to create a study plan? If your study habits aren’t strong, that could be why you’re slipping and struggling even more to grasp the material in a short amount of time. I’d strongly advise you to look into tutoring and help rooms and communicate with your professors so you understand the material as it builds. If not, you’ll continue to struggle in these classes and the ones that build on it!

10662,"See, I agree with you on the whole. I think that the government needs to stay the hell away from people's personal lives - their job is to keep up the rule of law (rights to life, liberty, and property), negotiate with other countries to the betterment of people (foreign and domestic, but obviously with the slant towards the domestic), and provide for the general welfare of the population (including healthcare, education, physical infrastructure, corporate regulation, etc).

I would imagine these last two points are what you would call ""big government"" and them overstepping on our freedoms - not putting words in your mouth, just stating my assumption.

From my perspective, these ARE protecting our freedoms. Want products to stay cheap? Better have good trade deals. Want products to be safe? Better have good corporate regulations (we've seen that they can't regulate themselves - leaded gasoline, PFAS, water/air pollution/denial). Want clean air/water? Same. Want good infrastructure for relatively cheap? A few $k/year in taxes and you get to use just about all roads, bridges, public education, etc infinitely!

You specifically mentioned universal healthcare. I'm a full-time mechanical engineer working for a major company. I pay - at a minimum - $120/month in premiums, and I have a $5000 deductible. So I will pay a minimum of $1440/year in healthcare if I don't use it, and up to $6440 if I do (and that's if I need things they cover!). Then if that disease is chronic? Now I either can't get private insurance or my premiums are going \*through the roof.\* We're talking $1000/month minimum (which I know, because I have family with chronic conditions). Now lets say we go to a universal healthcare system. My premium likely drops by 50% or more. My deductible is similar. If I get diagnosed with something chronic my premiums go up...0%. And now we still have a private healthcare option that has to COMPETE in a free market with those prices. All of a sudden their billions in profit (research is largely paid with taxpayer dollars already) falls to the hundreds of millions (not sad here...) and the care is better.

I'm not sure about you, bit going bankrupt because I get cancer that isn't what I would call freedom. Being required to have an employer subsidize the costs of my healthcare isn't what I would call freedom. Paying a small amount to ensure that I'm taken care of 100% if I get sick is what I call freedom.

(Caveat - universal healthcare isn't perfect, see Canadian waiting lines or the anger over the NHS in the UK. At the same time, I went into an in-network urgent care a few months back, saw a doctor for 15 minutes after waiting 45, and paid $90 out of pocket. No prescription, no testing, just a consult non-covid-related. I got sick in Germany last year - saw a doctor in 20 minutes, got a prescription filled around 10 minutes later for a total cost of...$10? As  foreigner not paying premiums. The doctor didn't look overworked/underpaid, but that's anecdotal.)

&gt;No offense, but this is ridiculous. You are **not** speaking for many students when you say this.  
&gt;  
&gt;Professor \*\*\* has clear and detailed videos that spell out exactly how to solve these problems. If you do the homework, watch the videos, and attend the recitations (AKA actually putting the work in), you might see your score go up.   
&gt;  
&gt;Looking at notes will require him to make the questions more difficult, with more word problems. He gives us reasonable questions on these quizzes. Actually, more than reasonable, they're basically the same as the homework/lecture problems.  
&gt;  
&gt;Our quiz on Thursday covers section 2.3. It's one section. He has TWO videos on it, has recitations, and an entire homework set on it. If you are still struggling, there's a team of TA's and the professor on standby in this forum to make sure you understand. You can watch videos online as well. If you are still struggling, you could probably email him and he, or a TA, would likely be willing to meet with you over Zoom to go over it.   
&gt;  
&gt;You, and other students consistently blame professors for making classes ""more difficult"". This is simply unTrue. These professors didn't ask for this semester to be online, we are all in the same boat. They are doing more than what is required of them in most cases, holding multiple office hours a day, setting up Zoom appointments at odd times out of consideration for international students.   
&gt;  
&gt;Worried about your mental health? Imagine trying to teach hundreds of students, working more than you would have during a normal semester, setting up online lectures, setting up Zoom meetings at 11PM, bending over backwards to make sure that your students understand something and then being told you are doing a terrible job.  
&gt;  
&gt;The entire world is sat behind a screen for the entire day. Most working adults are sat behind a screen from 7AM-5PM, attending multiple meetings, taking multiple phone calls, preparing large documents, coding, etc. They have the pressure of making sure food is on the table for their family, while you have the pressure of getting a decent grade.  
&gt;  
&gt;You're not worried about privacy or anything else, you want an easy way out of taking this class.   
&gt;  
&gt;I am sorry that you had to read this Professor \*\*\*, you and the TA's are doing a great job. I am also sorry that I had to say this on this forum, but I do not appreciate professors getting constantly bombarded with negativity when they are doing a good job.

10876,"Humble and sincere is about the best kind of attitude to have, I can appreciate that.

There’s not always something you can do, and some people are bad in terms of teamwork, and group ethics. 

I find the best strategy you can do is ask, “what can I do for the group?” Or try to set group roles. It is a silly elementary practice, but it works. Everyone needs a job. I find in the classroom, most of the times someone isn’t doing something, they genuinely don’t know what to be doing. As in, they are honestly not understanding. Having roles allows everyone a chance to focus on something, and contribute to the work at hand. 

The roles I use in my classroom are:


Recorder: the person who writes out the work, and is putting ideas on paper.

Facilitator: the person who makes sure everyone is speaking, and no one is dominating.

Time keeper: this person ensures the work is being done in a timely manner, and lets the group know how much time they believe each task will take. The time keeper also lets the group know when they need to focus and speed up.

Action/Clarifier: sometimes decisions between two group members occur, but the whole group heard the discussion, but not the final decision. The action clarifier states legibly: this is what we decided. This is also the person who contacts the instructor when the group needs it.

Questioner: checks for understanding. If someone isn’t doing anything, the questioner checks in with them, asking what questions they have/how they can help. The questioner is also the one to present whatever it is when it is done.

Your comments are framed in the typical manner of someone who is avoiding being constructively self-critical: look for opportunities to aggressively engage with people, gaslight them, refuse to reply to their (usually cordial) standard inquiries, refuse to back anything you say up, and do your best to distract from the reality that your statements are convoluted and baseless. It's certainly not working, but I don't think that matters to you.

People who are secure in their arguments rarely feel the need to push them on other people, unless they are calling out injustices, in which case that's not pushing a viewpoint it's standing up for what's right. 

You're just being reactive. There's nothing behind your statements other than insecurities, fear, and misdirected anger.

You are either motivated or you're not, I find a lot of my friends and others saying the same things you are and I can tell you the same thing I told them. If you're not happy with what you're doing then you won't be motivated to keep doing it, you need to find a way to enjoy your classes in their current environment. The real hard truth for a lot of people is they seem to be having tons of fun when they're not doing schoolwork ie. going out and drinking, partying, socializing, etc. and when it comes to sitting down and focusing on their work it doesn't interest them. Your brain is a muscle and the more you train it to enjoy frivolous fleeting experiences the less it will benefit you when you find yourself doing work. I realize this may sound anti-social and cynical but the truth is if you want to stay motivated on something it needs to take over another facet of your life and consume part of your routine. Think of how bodybuilders go from these normal guys who have normal and balanced lives to hulking masses of muscle, they sacrifice hours each day to nutrition and exercise and give up normality. Their motivation is to be the biggest guy in the room, your motivation needs to be the most educated person in the room. The bare minimum is easy, success isn't achieved at the bare minimum.",0.1132,0.4216,0.4652

Honestly, (aside from Kaiki obviously) I’ve been strongly in the Hanekawa camp, because of her extremely strong support she provides for Araragi in most of the arcs after &gt;! Meme disappears !&lt;. It was only in retrospect after I finished owari 2nd season when I realized how much people sleep on Hanekawa. I don’t know if I consider her “unstable” per se- I think she’s an extremely dynamically static character to the point of being meta (ofc Nishio Ishin is always meta with his writing). The change from her earlier static nature as both a character as well as her “whiteness” (as they describe in Nekomonogatari white) to an emotionally healthy human being and dynamic character is juxtaposed with her relative static supporting role in most other arcs. 

As for OPs, I have to say for me, Hachikuji’s OPs are my favorite, but just because of a style thing. In her monogatari second season arc, before &gt;! she disappears !&lt;, and the themes from her OPs start playing, man that was heartbreaking.",0.7263,0.2385,0.0352

My professors literally read off from a PowerPoint that they made, and when you ask on clarification on a subject I would get a response “ You should have learned this from (Insert class thats a direct pre-req that was cut short due to the pandemic last semester)” , * rereads the slide like saying it a second time will fix the issue*, or my personal favorite “Ask your TA/ classmates”. 

Telling my parents doesn’t help there answer is, it’s online it shouldn’t be that hard. Maybe if you stop watching YouTube maybe you’ll learn something, you’re just distracted, or I did online classes and *goes on tangent of their life story*. Yeah I remember mom you got your degree online for business management.(Not to shit on business majors sorry 😔) You can’t just compare your degree  to the one I’m trying to achieve. They’re apples and oranges.  How about you sit in all my lectures for the week see if you would understand, it’s nice to take this stand and comment from the peanut gallery.


I just had a office hour zoom netting a few days ago with one professor and his response is I’m sorry but there’s resources the university provides to help such as “helproom” and TAs that you can email. Then give me the lame excuse these are ever changing time that it’s difficult BS.

I had to grill in him telling him I’m putting myself $30k in debt with extra out of pocket expenses for book/software for you to give me a lame ass excuse for your poor habits in teaching? Your class is 4 credits which is equivalent to roughly $2500-3000 and and good chunk of my GPA. I’m not paying you to read slides for 20 mins and have us go in breakout groups where no one understand what was going on, so we sit in silence. I’m not paying you $2500 to google everything and use chegg to help me understand what’s the content. What’s the point of having your PHD or Master’s if you can’t explain a topic you should already know to someone who don’t understand. It’s not like I can’t go in another section and have a different prof, I need this class for my major and I have a person who “should be” qualified to teach the material giving a half ass effort. I was promised a high quality education during this pandemic and I have the right... No I’m entitled to it because Im paying for it and I want to get every dollars worth.

One thing I would like to say about the daily homework is that when you're told to attempt the problem, no one is expecting you to get it 100% correct on the first try. Learning has been proven to go better if students can ""fail constructively"" before being told exactly how to do something, so that's the intent there. That being said, I totally hear you on being frustrated about the lack of guidance. I can definitely understand how that could be super intimidating. Your metaphor of being ""tossed in the tank with sharks and told to swim"" illustrated that well for me. Another prof has been making tutorial videos for the first problem of the worksheet and then having students attempt the next 1-2 problems for daily homework instead of simply flying blind for the first problem with no example to go off of. I will see if that's something that the other profs are open to doing as well.

As for getting grades back on capstones in time to review them for the next one, I'm not involved with the grading process there, but I totally agree with you that you should be getting feedback before you take the next capstone. I'll see what I can do there.",0.2763,0.4848,0.2389

It feels like this class is taking up so much of my time outside of the actual lessons. The amount of assignments is never ending and I have other classes I need to work on. The daily homework just feels like stuff that's there to take up time, especially the kind where we have to do the first problem of a worksheet we're doing in the next class with no clue how to set up the problem. This was an incredibly frustrating issue during the energy unit. For one of the daily homework assignments we were told to attempt the first problem on the in class worksheet and no one had a single clue how to set things up. Then when we went into class, lo and behold, no one wanted to share their work. It feels like we're being tossed into a tank with sharks and being told to swim.

I feel like I'm never actually learning things during class so I end up struggling for hours working on the weekly homework. I just wish we could get more guidance in general. We don't really get to see examples of how to set up problems before getting put into breakout rooms. And after we finally figure out how to set up and solve a problem, the homework barely resembles what we did in class. And when homework is added on top of the Formal Lab project that my group is still confused by (we've talked to multiple people, asked the same questions and got very different answers, so we end up back at square one of confused as all hell) it just gives us more things to stress about, especially when we don't know how to do half of the problems on the homework.

Also I'm absolutely livid that we didn't get to see our grades from Capstone 1 before taking Capstone 2. Literally none of my classes have ever done that and the tiny little drop of confidence I had in Capstone 2 was absolutely shattered after seeing my Capstone 1 grade. And having 2 exams separated by one week  is absolutely bonkers to me. If we aren't sure of our mastery of the content included in the first one, why are we taking an exam that is dependent on our mastery of that content? While I'm thankful we get to do reflections to get points back, I'm still incredibly frustrated that all of these things are happening in such a short timeline. 

Honestly my frustration with this class probably all stems from the timeline. Everything is happening so fast that I don't have the chance to really absorb and understand the content before we're moving on to something else. My mediocre understanding of the content is further exacerbated by the ridiculous amount of work we have to do. This is also my first time touching physics since middle school, so I have no high school physics background I can rely on.

Some examples of those sacrifices would include sleep, eating, socializing, becoming an alcoholic on the weekends, etc. All jokes aside it's going to get more difficult but when you get to the point you've completed 2 or 3 years of courses you have to look yourself in the mirror and tell yourself that you're going to follow through and graduate no matter the circumstances you face. You will become more interested in your courses (hopefully) because they will actually relate to your major and you won't be doing gen-ed stuff anymore that just feels like busywork. One of the most difficult things for me to really understand about the process of college was the majority of your learning doesn't even start in your first couple years, those are more or less preparatory courses designed to challenge you and test whether or not you're capable of succeeding in your junior and senior year courses.

11687,"It gets both easier and harder. For instance, by your senior year (depending on your major, if you have a minor, etc), it should be decently easy. You should have only a few required courses that will be difficult, but to finish off credits you're going to be able to pad with fun courses. 

Also, post Freshman year you get more choice in the classes you take, you don't deal with exceedingly boring intro classes, you get more specialised courses, all of which (in my opinion) make it easier. The reason it's easier is because you become a lot more interested in the classes you're taking. 

Additionally, once you've got a handle on what on earth is going on in your major and how to do college courses, things get a lot more relaxing. Plus, in the 300 levels and beyond (again, depending on your major), you're going to get more repeat professors which is so nice because you know what they're looking for.

I’d say Robert Marzano’s work would be a great start for the “why this is important, and what evidence we have.”

As I was pushed to work online, my team used the book, “Balance with blended learning.” by Catlin Tucker. This helped us to plan how we can shift from working at home, towards learning at home and assessing/conferencing in person. This is because it requires a lot more time as the student is able to explain why their work meets the criterion. Due to limited time constraints on a classroom, a blended classroom helps free the instructor to have these conferences while other students are navigating the material.

Sure if we read the policies in place technically that is academic dishonesty according to all the respective outlined policies governing that class. However, the Lon-Capa for the course is very specific in what answers are acceptable ( I.e. must be kg•m/s not kgm/s   kg(m)/s, (kgm)/s, or kgms^-1)  so I have to say that for that to get flagged and potentially leave a blemish on the students record is unfair and to me not “cheating” especially given that no one responded to the students question.

Blatant cheating is something I don’t condone but if a student asks for help  with something minimal and does not give answers I feel like it’s acceptable if not for any other reason definitely because it’s been my experience that professors are not “teaching” as much as in person semester in favor of deferring to the students to essentially teach themselves or not really caring to address that the majority of the class struggling with a unit/topic like they would during a in person semester.",0.063,0.4358,0.5012

Solidarity is important. Advocating for fair practices is important. Shielding people that are devaluing your effort isn't doing them (or you) any good. 

Coming forward with suspicions doesn't ever convict someone. The Academic Dishonesty Report system has a builtin appeal process where students can receive a decision by a fair panel of faculty and students.

Enabling cheaters to think they won't be caught just makes the situation worse. If a friend of your's is cheating, ask them not to hurt your grade and degree and just drop a class that they aren't able to fairly earn the degree they want.",0.0378,0.2778,0.6844

Next, see if you can figure out why you failed the exam. This can be hard when you're not in a great mental place about it since it involves confronting a source of stress, so try breaking it down into manageable chunks (maybe look at one question a day until you've looked at them all). When you're looking at each question, try to figure out why you got it wrong. Are there central concepts you're not understanding? Did you just make a bunch of little mistakes that added up? Did you study for the exam? If so, were the things that you studied actually on the exam or did you not correctly anticipate the topics it would cover? This will help you figure out what to do differently next time.

I have a math class in particular that is massively focused on learning by practice and doing the work, and it's a decently tough math course. The biggest struggle is recitation for many of us is.. maybe 40% as effective as a face to face recitation? Unless you have an iPad with an apple pen or a writing software, it's awful difficult to show someone your work quickly to get feedback. The power of being able to just shove a notebook in someone's face when you need to... it's hard to grasp how important that can be. You can do 4x the amount of work in an hour over a Zoom call if you can show your work to others easily in writing. For the majority of my class, we don't have that resource. 

All of my bulk classes, my Econ courses... I hate to see this, they have been a waste of my time. They have been formatted awfully to an online frame. The teaching style for both of my courses boils down to Zoom lectures, video lectures, a weekly or biweekly homework set, exam. That's it. It's damn hard to sit through a 2 hour lecture of material that doesn't engage you. 

The best of my classes that has formatted online is my astronomy course. I'm in a very simple astronomy course to fulfill an easy physics credit, and my professor has made a course that is DUMMBBB effective for an online class. She uses a Pearson lab that has assigned homework, mixed with short, 10-20 minute lecture videos, usually only 1-3 before class, and a reading quiz before each class. During class, she uses a ""learning catalytics"" software that basically just asks questions in real time during class as she lectures or covers material. The engagement in that class is amazing for a really low-level course, and is what my Econ courses should have done. It's far more effective in terms of me retaining information and far less stress, and there is a very well defined schedule for this class, as well. 

All in all I think the math or other very analytical courses are in hot poo online, no way around it, and other more conceptual courses should take notes of my astronomy class. ^",0.2395,0.4138,0.3467

It's almost as if the profs don't think we have lives outside of school. I have a friend who has exams over the weekend which I find absolutely absurd.

Professors are all using different technologies and too much technology. My physics class alone uses 4 not counting D2L and zoom.

Think about this: what were your intentions on going? What did you think would come out of it? Psychic readings usually bring up things that you already knew but were afraid to admit to yourself. Of course there are psychic scams. There is no way to predict someone’s future so these questions should be disregarded.

All it does is Bluetooth pings devices around you and has an encrypted log of those who have been within 6 feet of you within the last few days.

The users themselves self report if they have tested positive and then it will notify all those devices in the log that they have been exposed to a positive case of Covid19.

So just to clarify, you consent to downloading, consent to turning the setting on, and consent to reporting. Nothing is being pushed on to you.

Say what you will, but this feature is not something y’all should be freaking out about. You are being tracked dozens of ways just by owning a smart phone, and NSA and FBI already routinely violate your rights long before this feature existed.

12184,"1) The reason people complain about the weeders (CSE 231/232) mainly come from the fact that they wait until the last minute to start the assignments. Start your assignments early, go to help room when you need help, and you'll be fine. The answer doesn't come to you easily, so take time to learn and do the assignments. Having 2-3 years of Python/Java experience will really help you with 231 since that's in Python while 232 is in C++. Just because a class is an intro does not mean it is easy - it's intended to intro you to the basics and for a lot people, it's a lot to handle. Also, 231 and 232 meet in once a week labs while you watch video lectures on your own time (which is not that bad.) You get what you put in, but you should be better off than others (I was in the same boat as you.)

2) For the most part, people are nice in the weed out classes, but when people get stressed/frustrated, then people are unhappy. Overall, people are less competitive here than UM and Purdue (I have friends that go to UM so I know,) but you'll deal with individuals that have the grubbers/Mr. I know it all attitude.

So many students struggle in that class and being online hasn’t helped either party (students and professors) when the professors refuse to listen to students, understand their students, accept and listen to criticism and feedback that their students have to offer. I know its hard for both parties to be online. We’re all screaming out for help but there’s no one there to offer any. Fellow student’s motivation are at an all time low. Study, fail, study, fail. The prof doesnt care.  He literally told the class after dropping the link to CAPs, “Drop the class if you’re depressed.” After he said that the zoom chat went wild and he lashed out again. “Drop the class if you’re depressed. You should just drop out of engineering and change your major if you’re depressed.” (Note: this is 96-99% what he said, however since this happened a couple weeks ago I cant remember it completely off the top of my head). This was also recorded on zoom, but they cropped that part out. 

In the end it crushes my heart to see students in this class being treated like this. Ive seen other profs put out their own surveys and ask if they’re going too fast, what can be changed? How should we proceed, and things to let BOTH parties know how they’re doing. Im paying the price for this class. If I were to evenly distribute my time among this and other classes I would be failing. Now, Im doing well and failing another.

TL;DR - I believe that you need to either print out the form, or go to the Local Clerk's Office

&amp;#x200B;

***Can I register to vote in Michigan if I’m a student from out of state?*** 

**Yes - If you are an out-of-state student attending school in Michigan,** you can register to vote at your school address in Michigan, or your home address to vote in your home state’s elections. 

If you are an out-of-state student and would like to register to vote in Michigan, and if there are **more than 14 days** before Election Day, you can visit your city or township clerk’s office to register OR you can download the [**State of Michigan Voter Registration Application**](https://www.michigan.gov/documents/MIVoterRegistration_97046_7.pdf) to mail to your clerk with a valid form of identification (a copy of your home state ID is sufficient). Some clerks’ offices even accept an emailed form, so contact your local clerk’s office to find out the best way to submit your application. If you are already registered to vote in Michigan and need to update your address, you will follow these same steps and resubmit your new registration using your current address.

**During the 14 days** before AND ON Election Day (Michigan has same-day registration, meaning you can register to vote on Election Day), you will need to visit your local clerk’s office to register to vote or update your registration address AND you will need to provide proof of residency documentation. Learn more about what proof of residency documents are acceptable for college students in our [**Proof of Residency section**](https://www.michigan.gov/sos/0,4670,7-127-1633_8716_93658_102162-538201--,00.html#Proof).

Note: You can only vote in one state, so registering to vote in Michigan means you cannot vote in your home state and vice-versa. If you wish to vote in your home state, you can visit your state’s elections website to learn more about requesting an absent voter ballot to vote by mail.

***If I’m an out-of-state student attending school in Michigan, can I register to vote online?***

If you have a state of Michigan driver’s license or state ID card you can register to vote online at [**Michigan.gov/Vote**](https://mvic.sos.state.mi.us/). 

If you are an out of state student attending school in Michigan, and do not have a State of Michigan ID, you can register to vote using a paper application form, which is available at [**Michigan.gov/Vote**](https://mvic.sos.state.mi.us/). Once you fill out this form, you will need to return it to your local clerk either by mail or by dropping it off at their office. 

To learn more about what options are available to you, visit [**Michigan.gov/Vote**](https://mvic.sos.state.mi.us/).",0.1041,0.8038,0.092

I think part of the challenge with computer science is that you're developing a skill (programming) on top of everything that you're learning (algorithms, operating systems, etc.).  It's sort of like a music performance major in that way, and they put in a lot of long hours, too.

Different people develop that skill at dramatically different rates.  (And this has nothing to do with gender, skin color, etc.)  For some people it comes very naturally.  Lots of others have to work at it, and for some it seems like they can't get their minds to work that way, no matter how much they want to, and how good they are at other things.

If you're confident about your computational math classes, then I expect the ""book learning"" part of CS would not be a problem for you.  Being interested in something is by far the most important ingredient, in my experience.

Hello,

 

I wanted to share information about available resources for MSU students at Counseling and Psychiatric Services (CAPS). *Please distribute widely.*

 

CAPS Connect:

We are now in our fourth week of CAPS Connect. Our website has been updated to reflect the signup links for all CAPS Connect opportunities. The links can be accessed by visiting: https://caps.msu.edu/services/CAPSConnect.html

Please distribute this link within your college and departments. 

 

Listening Spaces:

CAPS continues to hold listening spaces for students and will be offering at least two listening spaces focused on the upcoming presidential elections. Additionally, we have a number of listening spaces geared towards students of color.  Please see the following upcoming listening spaces. Please email us for individual listening space flyers or additional information.

 

Latinx Students Listening Space - Latinx-identifying undergraduate and graduate students. Issues within the Latinx community and Latinx experience will be explored.

Contact facilitator indicated for link or questions, Jessica Oyoque-Barron, LMSW at Oyoqueje@msu.edu.

Virtual Listening Space for International Students - This is a listening space for international students, especially for those who are unable to return to Michigan this Fall semester. A space with a goal to listen, to connect, and to support each other. Fridays 10:00 to 11:00 am, October 2 through November 20, 2020, facilitated by Zen Zhong, M.Phil.Ed, LLPC. Contact facilitator for questions, Zen Zhong, M.Phil.Ed, LLPC at zhongz@msu.edu. Registration Link: https://msuhipaa.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJMucOispz8pGdVdF4wkJmUmg_ozIHtdPxYz

Black Women’s Listening Space - A CAPS Virtual Listening Space for Black Women to be heard, breathe, grow and lead (open to undergraduate and graduate MSU students). Every other Monday 3:30 to 4:30 pm, on the following dates: October 5th &amp; 19th; November 2nd &amp; 16th, facilitated by Dr. Talitha Easterly. Contact facilitator for link or questions, Dr. Talitha Easterly at easterl5@msu.edu.

Pre-Election Listening Space - The purpose of this space will be to provide students time to process and share their feelings about the election. This is not a space for debate or to persuade students’ voting choices (attendees must be an MSU student). Tuesday 1:00 to 2:00 pm on October 27, 2020, facilitated by Jeff Baker, MA, LLP and Mike Evitts, MS. Contact Jeff Baker, MA, LLP at bakerj76@msu.edu with any questions. Registration Link: https://msuhipaa.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJckce6srjIrG9zgzXQuD-mmuKglQsYqDHmo

Post-Election Listening Space - This Listening Space hosted by MSU CAPS is meant to serve students who need a safe place to talk and listen post-election. Wednesday 12:00 pm on November 4, 2020 facilitated by Dr. Mark Patishnock, Dr. Lee Wang, and Dan Murphy, MA. Contact Dan Murphy at murph761@msu.edu with any questions. Registration Link: https://msuhipaa.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJ0vduqrqTwrG9f0LBbgkj_NcE-2hgB3Yz_T

Allyship in 2020 Listening Space - These discussions are for MSU students, to provide support and focus during a time when many students might be just learning about their racial identity, unsure of where they want to go from here, working through insecurity related to privilege, or struggling to conceive of building a positive identity that is also anti-racist, pro-Black, pro-Indigenous, pro-POC, etc. Thursday 3:00 to 4:00 pm on October 22, 2020 and Thursday 1:00 to 2:00 pm on October 29, 2020 facilitated by Dr. Gail Anderson and Angela Partridge BSN RN. Contact Dr. Gail Anderson at ande1951@msu.edu with any questions.

12600,"I can see why, in some cases, a student might intentionally chose to tank a class in order to have the ability to retake a course to earn a better grade or to learn the material better.  We know that our existing retake policy incentivizes students who are earning a 2.0 or better (but less than they want to earn) to sometimes intentionally tank a class.  In that way, NR-C is not different from our normal retake policy.

That being said, there are reasons why intentionally tanking a class in order to qualify for NR-C might be a bad idea.  You've got a lot of sunk costs in terms of time and energy in the class that you'll lose if you chose to tank it.  You might find yourself later having wished you had instead taken that 2.5 or 2.0 and not have to retake the entire course.  Given the very strange situation that the pandemic is creating for everyone, lower than usual grades this semester will be easy for people to overlook in the future.

I'd recommend that, before you consider tanking a course to be able to retake it, you talk through the relevant issues with an academic advisor.  Here's how you find your advisor

By taking NR-C instead of the numerical grade, their retake of the class would not be counted toward their 20 credit cap on retakes and the original grade would not impact their cumulative GPA.

They'll help you assess how much danger you're in, and help you plan some concrete things to take care of yourself.

Your description of your life is a perfect description of serious depression.  It's really hard to dig yourself out of that by yourself--I tried for years without success.  Please consider finding some sort of counseling in your own community that you can stick with for a while.

(Note that the law guarantees your privacy--your parents have no access to your medical records, even if you get counseling through their medical coverage.)

- such a diverse engaging community. You will have no issue finding your place

-there are resources available for your studies whenever you need them 
-honestly, the food isn’t that bad (I mean it’s not the best but it definitely isn’t bad) 

Cons
- I wasn’t a fan of the partying aspect (especially nowadays but to each their own
-winters suck 
-sometimes the professors aren’t the best but you’ll get that at every school

I’m sure MSU will make up for it from all the cuts made possible by not having most students in physical classrooms.

Edit: Since I’m being downvoted, [Zoom’s public pricing](https://zoom.us/pricing) states their most expensive license is $199/user/year. More than likely, MSU receives a discount since we have such a large volume of people to license. Even if there is not a discount, a $199 license will provide a student access to Fall and Spring classes (30 credits x $550 tuition = $16,500). That means MSU is only paying (max) $6 per credit per student to use Zoom for classes.

12881,"Freshman and sophomore PLS level 100-200 classes are primarily very informative although a bit basic concepts of government and politics with some lengthy writing assignments and deeper analysis in the 200 level courses. They are all taught by professors with an occasional lecture from a TA. Every professor holds office hours and most of them will work with you to find a time that fits your schedule if you're struggling in their classes. The class structures depends on the professor really but from my experience they're more likely to be a mix of lecture, discussion, and reading based with some emphasis on in class quizzes and assignments so you need to come prepared. I'd say the average class size was like 200 people for 100 level courses and about 80-100 for 200 level courses. In my particular classes I wasn't all that tuned in to the social environment really, I can't give you much of a reference for what it would be like for international students. On average I probably studied like 1-2 hours a week for my 100 and 200 level courses with maybe 2 hours of homework additional plus the just over 1 hour lecture twice a week. 

As far as 300 level courses you're going to notice a significant downsize in your courses class size to maybe 25-30 people and the class structures are going to be much more dedicated to conceptual dynamics of politics, methodology, and implementation of concepts. You will do a lot more reading and a lot more writing, right now I'm taking 2 PLS 300 level courses and I spend roughly 8 hours a week on them combined for studying and reading. Class structures are more focused around applying political theories and practices among your peers on questions raised by the professors, kind of like a vocal test of if you know what you're talking about or not and have done the readings. Weekly testing is common and you'll likely have to write a few papers around 10 pages in length but will be given ample time (usually 6-8 weeks) applying what you've learned. I actually prefer these classes a lot over the traditional testing on specific items from a syllabus with a weekly schedule, it helps you better work through your understanding of the course concepts and you're not deducted full points for having just a close answer like you might have been in a traditional setting. Just make sure to pick a minor that accounts for the time you're going to spend each week doing large assignments within the courses and try to buckle down on getting every difficult subject out of the way for yourself well ahead of taking your 300 level courses. Don't try to take 2 math classes, a CSE course, a lab course, and multiple PLS higher level courses at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

That all being said I have one gripe about the program in particular regarding scheduling, PLS 100, 101, 201, and 202 which are all required courses fall on corresponding semesters meaning you can only take 100 and 201 on the fall and only take 101 and 202 in the spring. If you happen to miss out and not make it into one of those courses for whatever reason with your schedule you have to wait an entire year to get into one or beg and plead the professor to let you in their course like I had to. In the order I listed above is the pre-req order and you have to do all of them in order (I don't know why, they have hardly anything to do with one another honestly, it's not like if you missed 100 one semester you couldn't do 101 because you lacked the knowledge or something). You will also find a lot of the 300 level courses have pre-req courses that are obscure and unrelated to your degree path, I suggest trying to ignore them as best you can even if they fit perfectly in your schedule as they're typically for niche poli-sci students who are really interested in various subtopics of the spectrum and you probably aren't much at all interested in the things they will cover. Lastly, at all costs you must avoid taking PLS 300 courses with little to no data on the courses professors or Koofers ratings. It might sound like a neat idea to take a chance at a new professors in a new PLS course, it's not.. you will regret everything about taking the class. Stick to proven and time tested professors who teach a range of the PLS course levels and develop a close relationship with them and you'll do great.",0.3614,0.5683,0.0703

Sometimes, though, when systems we're in have shoddy parts, our best options are things like what chrisbkreme noted and suggested. Unless we can easily overhaul all aspects of MSU's structural problems, we're going to need things like ASMSU. They put in a lot of work to help people combat the institutional problems at MSU that are too deeply embedded to change in other ways. It has worked in many ways, and it does and will work in many ways, even if it's not the complete overhaul we'd like.

There are far more problematic parts of MSU's infrastructure and other universities' infrastructures, including sexist, racist, and exclusionary practices that are holding on from the past and still need to be done away with. We're all frustrated with many aspects of student experiences, and the best way to address that right now is supporting each other, our allies in other parts of the hierarchy, and doing things like participating in ASMSU.

&gt;Dear Spartans,

&gt;This year has been unlike anything we’ve ever seen, and I’m proud of the hard work our faculty, staff and students have put in to make the best of a Spartan education during this pandemic.
Our faculty and staff have been working diligently to keep our campus safe and continue the world-class education we are trusted to deliver. Our students have remained dedicated to their classes and disciplines all while managing this pandemic with courage and determination. I appreciate that thousands of MSU students are taking action every day to reduce the spread of COVID-19. And I continue to appreciate the dedication and efforts I see in the Spartan community. The leadership shown by our students is extraordinary, and it instills confidence that we can continue to tackle this together.

&gt;I know many of you have questions about the spring semester, so I write you today with some highlights of recent MSU leadership and our task force decisions:

&gt;•	Spring semester for undergraduate classes will start as scheduled Jan. 11, 2021.

&gt;•	Approximately 2,500 additional single-occupancy residence hall spaces will be available to students who want or need to live on campus. 

&gt;•	MSU will offer more in-person classes, with a focus on courses that students need in order to graduate on time.

&gt;•	MSU will join most of the other Big Ten universities in canceling spring break in 2021.

&gt;•	The spring calendar will include three midweek days without classes spread throughout the semester to provide breaks for students.

&gt;•	Undergraduate instruction will end April 23, 2021, and finals week will be held one week earlier than previously scheduled to allow for a weeklong period for graduation ceremonies.

&gt;•	As part of a COVID-19 testing program, MSU will require participation in the COVID-19 Early Detection Program for students living on campus and undergraduate students coming to campus during the spring semester due to, for example, in-person classes, labs or work. Current program participants, faculty, staff and other student populations will also have the opportunity to continue in the program.

&gt;The fall has shown us that our systems and protocols set up for on-campus housing have proven effective and successful, and we are confident we can return more students to our residence halls. Many Spartans continue to express a desire to live on campus. Residential and Hospitality Services has developed a request process that will be offered soon, with a priority on Spartans needing additional assistance to be academically successful, those who have an in-person or hybrid class and first-year students. All students currently living on campus will remain in their current rooms.

&gt;In the fall, only about 40 in-person classes were offered at MSU. This spring, we expect to offer about 400 in-person educational experiences. We will prioritize offering classes that can only be taught in person in order to keep our students on track for an on-time graduation. To protect the health and wellness of the community, most classes still will be offered only as online courses.
Graduate and professional programs may have different calendars and schedules. Faculty will receive more information from their deans and colleges about class modalities and schedules in the coming days. Students also will receive more information about class schedules and on-campus housing opportunities soon. Further information on required participation in the COVID-19 Early Detection Program, also known as the Spartan Spit Test, will be made available closer to the start of the next semester.
I appreciate your diligent efforts to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus by wearing your masks and practicing physical distancing. Keep up the great work — we don’t want to lose the opportunities for which we have all worked so hard. Together, we will.

&gt;Sincerely,",0.8567,0.138,0.0053

As for trump and the military, his actions did nothing against LGBTQ the decision was made to prevent people transitioning from joining ONLY WHILE THEY WOULD RELY HEAVILY ON HORMONES 

2 of the top 16 national adoption agencies are christian ran and so they shouldn’t be legally required to place a kid into a home that goes against their morals, although they still can if they so choose but it is entirely fair to let the agency choose based on their beliefs and analysis which is probably why those 2 agencies have the best placement success ratings

If you wanna talk about birth control, we live in a free market place... again if an owner has certain morals they shouldn’t be forced to cover the expenses of something that goes against their personal beliefs but they can if they choose, if they choose not to and it’s a deal breaker for you you have the ability to take your skills elsewhere and seek employment at a business that more suitably matches your wants and beliefs

And while we are at it Roe v. Wade was actually decided on a republican majority Supreme Court with most of the votes in favor of choice coming from the republicans and has been upheld twice since again both times under republican majority courts

And do you know Biden’s plan will actually affect people?
You can go to Biden’s tax plan and on pages in the 40s-60s you’ll find

-Biden’s plan wants to tax you on your home at 3% of its value , this is in addition to what you already pay in property taxes

-Biden’s plan includes that for families making $50,000 or more a year will see their taxes go up $7,800 over a 10 year period + an average loss of $750 a year from repealing Trumps middle class tax cuts

-Biden’s plan also wants to tax your 401k IRAs 
Until 1983 people paid no taxes on Social Security until Biden put up&amp; sponsored a bill to tax social security by 50% and later raised it to 80% 


Biden isn’t a man of the people. He lies, plays identity politics, and only says what he thinks sounds good. This is evident by his comments on fracking &amp; oil last night which Trump called him out for and actually did post the evidence of his clear contradiction. 
Also for the 545 children separated from their families at the border, which Trump said during the debate was in large part due to coyotes bringing them here with unknown ( presumably bad) intentions 
I recommend reading the NBC article from 10/20 on this were you’ll be able to see that the kids actually are in safe conditions, some even living with aunts/uncles in the US bc their parents who did respond to communication attempts said they don’t want their kids coming back to their home countries, and that for a majority the reason they can’t find their parents is bc receiving (intentionally) incorrect contact info from the adults... can’t call a parent who doesn’t leave the right phone number, but why is it they don’t leave the right phone number? Maybe because they were actually coyotes and not their parents or the parents see leaving the kids as more beneficial to their lives than having them go back to their origin country
With of which contradict Biden’s statement that when using “catch &amp; release majority showed up to court dates” and more accurately defend Trumps assertion that less than 1% actually showed back up

Obama has been towards legalizing gay marriage since day 1, and gay marriage was legalized through his presidency.

Trump has pushed forward restrictions on trans people joining the military, removed adoption rights from same-sex couples (by allowing religious organizations the right to refuse service), and instated justices who have a history of anti-lgbtq rulings.

Ulysses S. Grant created the Klu Klux Act which allowed the federal government to fight terrorist groups and entities such as the KKK in 1871. Trump’s official declaring it a terrorist group was simply to offset his declaration that “antifa” is a terrorist organization. Both of these things are strange moves because terrorist organizations had not been considered domestic up until this point.

Stop regurgitating everything you hear on Fox News or OAN.

Also, the economy moves much slower than 4 years. Many of the ups Trump had when he started are on public services, or policies that were created during the Obama administration. Trump has since then removed/destroyed many of these.

Also, also, more people with jobs does not mean more people out of poverty. The staggering difference between upper class, middle class, and the ratio of people in each group has become even further disconnected than ever.

It just doesn’t make sense to me. They screwed everybody over because they didn’t finalize what classes were going to be held in person or online BEFORE sending the email so now people don’t know whether they should go back to campus or not. It’s just not fair that we have to stay at home while other schools that have higher cases than us are back on campus. Stanley and the administration do not give two fucks about our mental health and students everywhere are suffering. Everyone’s GPAs are plummeting and these professors are showing no mercy. 

I didn’t make a lot of friends my freshman year and I really wanted to make up for it sophomore year but I guess that’s not gonna happen. Now when we come back for 2021 everybody’s going to have their groups together and I’m gonna be alone. I’m a really shy person I really don’t like talking to people unless they come to me first (I know that’s a bad thing but I’m working on it) and it takes me a while to get comfortable with them. But I’ve been working on myself around the summer and I had goals to join more clubs be more outgoing in my classes gain relationships with my professors and just overall make good friends. I’m at home for the semester and  I don’t talk to anybody. I don’t have a good relationship with my parents so I try my best not to really talk to them during the day and isolate myself in my room just doing work. Most of the people that I know are in Greek life back on campus partying it up every weekend (all over snap). Every single time I see these girls at frats/bars I just wanna throw my phone at the wall because these are the people who are ruining it for the rest of us (yet they were still able to go back to campus smh). They don’t even try to hide the fact that they are partying it’s posted on all of their profiles  like wtf. I just want to go back to campus, I just miss it so much. I really regret my freshman year and taking for granted the opportunities I was given. I’m more depressed than ever, therapy doesn’t even help as much anymore. I’ve lost my 4.0 in almost all of my classes and I had a goal to at least get over a 3.5 this semester. My parents don’t see the reason why were all complaining about online classes because they think that we have more time to do the work. 

I’m just tired man. I know I rant on here a lot but frankly apps like these and other social media outlets are the only ways I can connect with people. Sometimes I just want to go to bed and never wake up.  Every day I get bombarded with schoolwork and I get behind even though I dedicate my weekends to do my busy work.

I cried for hours that night because MSU was my escape. I had hope for going back in the spring and now this. I’ve had it with this institution. I’m sick and tired of being optimistic about what would happen next only to be hit with more disappointment.

Trump has worked to undo the 94 crime bill, passed the first step act, historic low unemployment for POC &amp; women,  created opportunity zones, made lynching a federal crime, made the KKK a terrorist organization &amp; denounced them many times, increased penalties for False reporting, funded training for use of alternatives to force such as de-escalation&amp; duty to intervene, increased funding for body cameras for police, increasing record retention, etc.

13287,"I have no interest in football, but I decided I should experience it at least once before I graduated. So my senior year, I got some friends together and found cheap tickets for a home game versus Penn State in late October.

I got a student tail gating pass and they said it started at 7am (I think the game started at 12pm), so we were there bright and early. It was super cold out and there was no one there. But around 10am it started getting packed and the sun came out, so we had a lot more fun. In fact, we were late to the game because we were finally hanging out with the other tailgaters. But then we all walked in a big group to the stadium and got to watch the game. 

I have no interest in football and so I hated the initial experience. The tickets were cheap because they were in the middle of a section and there was no room. It was body to body and if we wanted to get out to go to the bathroom (which after drinking all morning, we had to do quite often) we had to basically climb over disgruntled people trying to watch the game. It was super uncomfortable and I would not do it again (but if I liked football, it might be worth it).

However, it started raining/thundering so the game got paused and everyone had to evacuate the stadium. My friends (who had continued drinking during the game with some booze we snuck in) had gone to the bathroom and it was very challenging trying to find them in the huge crowd evacuating. We had no idea how long the rain delay would last, but we went to Brody and got some food while we waited and a few hours later they announced the game was back on, so we rushed back. At this point, the stadium was almost empty because most people didn't want to come back. So we got much better seats, with lots of space to ourselves. 

It was the fourth quarter and MSU was down by 3, and with 20 seconds left in the game they got a touchdown and everyone went wild. It was an awesome moment to be a part of. I'm definitely glad I went to at least one game while I was at MSU.",0.4233,0.37,0.2066

Don't get caught up in the social media world missing what everyone at home is doing. For me I lived in an apartment community so that it didn't feel so isolated. I saw my neighbors, made friends with the guys down the hall. Coffee shops, events, and other normal pre-covid events helped me feel more independent and on my own.

Don't be scared to call Mom when you're at the grocery store because you don't know what kind of sugar to get to make cookies, or to call Dad when your car starts making funny noises. While it may seem like you are failing, I can assure you that in most normal family relationships, your parents welcome those seemingly annoying calls and are appreciative that you still need them.

There are several times that I feel like I have imposter syndrome, but I feel like everyone gets that way. I embrace those feelings, and realize that yes I can have ice cream for breakfast, and yes I get to chose if I want to live at X instead of Y. You'll learn how to be your own best advocate, because most people won't.

Get those internships, apply for anything you can -- alongside with actively applying for jobs you may get lucky and land a job vs. an internship. But those internships can teach you a lot about the corporate world and expectations in the CSE space.

13399,"If you're comparing your skills to someone who's been working for a couple of years, don't.  MSU isn't a vocational school--the program gives you a broad and deep foundation that you then build on for the rest of your career.  In five years, you'll be outperforming that person who knows every Python library method but has no understanding of what's happening under the covers.

Unfortunately, some employers (unreasonably) expect new college grads to be 100% productive from the start, and that's a situation to be avoided if at all possible.  When you get to interviews (and you will), ask the manager what they expect the learning curve to be like once you start.  Look for clues about whether they're trying to hire someone who'll be a long-term asset to the company (and thus worthy of investment) or just a coding bot that they'll discard once the current product ships.  Yeah, you may weed out some employers that way, but the ones left will be much better fits for you.

Salary is a hard issue.  Normally I'd say to avoid being unemployed for too long, because that's a red flag on a resume, but these aren't normal times.  Maybe more relevant is what being unemployed could do (or is doing) to your confidence.  You could set your sights lower just to get a job, with the full intention of continuing to look and jump to a better job when one comes along.  Remember that employers (even the good ones) will ultimately make choices on the basis of their own self-interest;  you're entitled to do the same.

Don't worry about the GPA.  3.x is respectable, and ten minutes after you start your first job it will become irrelevant, and stay that way for the rest of your life.

/u/thergoat has already said this, but it's super-important:  Use this time to build up your skills, increase your visibility, and build your confidence.  Come up with self-assigned projects and publish them on GitHub.  (I'm jdykstra there and the Arduino repos are examples of things you could do.)  Find an open source project to contribute to.  Answer questions on Stack Overflow or here on Reddit.

And network with every person you know in the business.  Reconnect with people who were in classes with you.  Find out what happened to that TA who you thought was good.  Stalk (in a nice way) recent CSE grads.  Ask them what they're working on, what their workday is like, what drives them nuts, whether they've got any suggestions for you.

Additionally, I have actually met plenty of other cool vets in my classes. They are easy to spot, although I’m not exactly sure why. Maybe it is simply a maturity issue but I can’t quite put my finger on it.

Broad really isn’t as competitive as people on here are making it out to be. Apply yourself to your studies and you will get in.

You asked for advice, think about/do these things:

1. Accept that no one is perfect. You have an engineering degree from a fantastic CSE program - you are deserving of a decent salary, and you can earn it.
2. Take the advice of /u/SeemlyRadiance and talk to Garth. The people at The Center are literal heroes. He won't solve all your problems, but he'll set you on the right track.
3. Accept your abilities as they are. A lack of an internship isn't great, but its \*far\* from the end of the world.
4. Now that you've accepted your skills, it's time to thoroughly describe them. Polish your resume, get down all your major projects (remember 335 with Onsay if you were lucky? Some of those projects can go on there). You graduated from MSU, you know C++ and Python at least, even if you're not amazing at them.
5. 20 \* 2080 = $41,600. No, you absolutely should not accept a job making less than $20/hour long-term. You are an engineer, you can make at least $30/hour on a bad day. You can make at least $30-50/hour on a fair day. Apply for jobs. Apply for ALL the jobs. Every one.
6. $41,600 is a fair amount of money, and there is \*no shame\* in living with your parents for a while, or having roommates while you get on your feet. Take the lower paying job if you need to to start out and \*keep applying to all the jobs.\* Finding a job is easier once you already have one.
7. If you feel like building more ""practical skills"" buy an arduino, get it up and running, and just keep tinkering. Post what you make on a Github account. It's ok if that sounds confusing/difficult - I promise you can do it.
8. Get a LinkedIn if you don't have one already - polish it, set it to looking for jobs.
9. Polish your handshake, apply for jobs on there too.

I had more internships than anyone has any business getting, in several states/cities. Let me tell you, it's not as hard as it seems. No shame in being worried - this is a major point of transition in your life - but there's no need to be scared. I'm 2 hours from the nearest airport, 12 hours by car from my family in a new town - people are human, community can be found anywhere. Reach out to friends, family, locals, clubs, etc.

Imposter syndrome is a thing. Most of us go through it at some point or another. I'm sure the difficulties of Covid only make it harder. You'll get there - you can do it.

13420,"Apartments are kind of a touchy subject around MSU, on one hand you can take the route of finding your own place within 1/10th of a mile of campus with many of the new constructed buildings and forego the whole necessity of a car. Parking in East Lansing carry's a premium of around $100/month or more for just a parking spot and add some extra budget to your apartment because you're no longer paying for full insurance, gas, etc. and find a nice studio very close for a little over $1000/month. On the other hand if you are looking for something cheaper and with roommates the majority of the older buildings or complexes in the area are terribly managed and still overpriced. You might end up paying like $900/month each to split a 4 bedroom apartment that's 1000 square feet and it comes with maybe 1 or 2 parking spots that you will have to negotiate with your roommates over if you so choose. Those locations are often a bit too far to walk, close enough to ride a bike comfortably in the fall and spring but winter is another story. If you plan to commute to classes  there's only a select few parking garages in the area so you'd probably still have to walk an extra 1/4 to 1/2 a mile to get to a building. I'd really just recommend finding a nice studio on grand river or very close for the $1000-1200/month range and try to cut down on your other monthly costs. Also if you're thinking about it you absolutely need to get into an apartment lease early, they usually book all the lease options 9-10 months before the lease is set to start in the next school year and you can usually save a lot of money as the availability dwindles the prices go up.

There are far bigger issues at hand. One of the biggest is psychological issues of students (even before COVID). You can search through this sub on people screaming out how lonely they are (numerous studies that cover this as well), how hard it is to meet people, how heavy the workload is. HUNDREDS of students being furloughed (mostly from RHS). 

If there is one thing to take away from the training I hope its not going to be **ONLY** ethic diversity. As many Universities try to push this narrative as the only type. But also diversity of thought and viewpoint. Ways that we can bring each other together in divisive times, and how students can understand one another, who come from different backgrounds.

Life hits us fast and hard, and in ways that always seem to be new and inventive in how they hurt us.
The advice I can give is to try and take back control a little at a time. Start with tasks that are small, doing just a little bit at a time. It's not going to solve everything at once, but some effort is more than none and hopefully that little effort will grow gradually over time. Try to find the things that make you feel excited (hobbies or otherwise) and do those when you are starting to feel overwhelmed again.

13726,"i'm so sad. i thought that this term was going to be a great fresh start for my education. i'm a transfer student from Kettering University where the classes and professors were generally pretty bad. i transfered in in the summer, and took three classes, one in the first half and two in the second. everything was okay as the classes were designed to be online and i didn't have much of a workload. the professors were all great and incredibly helpful.

this term i'm taking the usual four classes. i transferred in admitted to the engineering college as a computer engineering student. the workload is expectedly heavy. 

i moved into an apartment prepared to be in person. my roommates and i signed the lease before it was confirmed that we were going online. in hindsight, i was foolish to expect it to be in person. so anyways, i'm stuck here, but i go home often.

i have always been pretty keen on my schoolwork. i don't get all A's all the time but it's uncommon that i get a C or below. this term has taken a turn for the absolute worst.

a couple weeks in the semester i ended my relationship with someone of two years. we are still on good terms, but it gave me a lot of stress. it has since snowballed from there.

i didn't do anything for two weeks. no notes, no class, no labs, i just didn't do anything. i got behind and eventually i started half-assing some classes, but others i kept doing nothing. time goes on, and so far its been a month probably since i've really tried working hand. i missed quizzes, i missed a project even. i'm almost certain i've failed a class, and i'm not sure i care anymore. 

i have no hope. i feel so utterly defeated. i have never been this unmotivated to do anything. i'm scared and i don't know what to do. i think the only consolation that i have is that there might be somebody else who is going through the same thing. but even then, that doesn't excuse my own laziness. it hits especially hard to see how depressed other students are in this term, to see them giving it their all and still feeling awful about everything. it makes me feel guilty, like i don't deserve to feel downtrodden because i really just haven't been giving a shit at all. 

i don't expect anyone to read all of this. i think i have been waiting to let all of this out but have no one to tell it to. i made this account just to make this comment. i know its not, but my education feels like it is over. i have no idea what my future will be like now that i'm pretty sure that i've failed a class. i feel utterly unmotivated and like a failure.",0.0676,0.2352,0.6972

With that said, having severe ADHD is making this semester even worse. Significantly worse. An example: Disregard every affect that ADHD has had on my life, except for simply timing my medication doses throughout the day. Hitting the snooze button once can cause a snowballing downfall in my daily cycle for weeks. There are so many damn things related to the timing alone that just ruin my days. Can't eat too late, too early, too much... I take the morning extended-release meds with breakfast and the evening instant-release meds with dinner. Like imagine that every time you ate, you had a timer for when you can eat, how long until your appetite is suppressed, how long until you can and will be productive, how long until you gotta eat and medicate again, how long it'll keep you awake, how long until you can socially interact (without feeling as if you're wasting your time). I gotta take these morning meds about 1.5 hr before my morning class or exam because that's when the first peak hits. I know damn well none of you have been able to wake up 1.5 hr's before something if you crammed the night before. These meds have, essentially, 8ish and 5ish hour commitments to them.

13746,"So as an insider here—
There are many faculty who are extremely petulant about online classes.  And I mean regressing to junior high petulant.  As a result, they simply refuse to adequately prepare.

Then there is the despair contingent—given the frankly obscene amount of work that non-TT or TT (but not yet tenured) faculty are still expected to do, many have given up.  Not just on students, but on life in general.  Imagine the worst professor you have ever had. Now imagine if he was your boss.  Now imagine if you had to impress him enough with nothing but a truly odd set of expectations of research so you can not be fired randomly. (Or in other words, imagine the retail experience of Hell and then put in the added stakes of your identity and passions being entangled into it.)

Then there are those of us who try to do the right thing.  These folks are usually liked or even loved by students, but are regarded with great suspicion by colleagues or upper level folks because “too many people are passing” or you might not be “rigorous” enough (despite not having any kind of conceptual or operational definition of such a concept!).  

There’s a lot faculty hide from students.  Some of them hide to deceive and punish folks.  Some of them hide because they are trying not to unload drama magma on their students.  And some of them hide in order to shield their students from the raw shitstorm that is happening in academia right now.

Covid leadership at the *state* level, in Michigan, is good. At the federal level? The president and his administration downplay the reality of the pandemic, obscure the truth, try to censor actual scientists, and dismiss the difficulties hundreds of thousands of Americans are facing. In fact, they have now said they want to open the country up, while Fauci (and a multitude of other doctors and scientists) think we need a federal mask mandate because we're not even close to being out of the water, unless we properly address things. How could you actually believe Trump is doing anything properly or constructively? You can't, realistically.

I was hoping for better from a new president, however it seems this administration is making rules for their community with absolutely no input from the student body. I have received no link to submit a survey, no vote, no townhall to voice my concerns, just emails letting me know what the administration decided was “good enough” without any input. This calendar is pathetic. I am already sick and tired of Zoom classes, missing assignments, being expected to stay after “just a few minutes” all the time because professors think since we are online, staying late has no impact anymore. Taking away a genuine break from all this is just another disappointing adaptation this administration deemed was going to be good enough. A Tuesday and Wednesday break does NOT help the students decompress as a real spring break does. Not to mention the totally blind and pointless April 22 &amp; 23 “study break”

How many of you studied over your spring breaks before? Personally, I did not do any schoolwork over my spring breaks in the past. Now professors are being encouraged to treat these days as “Study” opportunities. Sure, they are being asked to “not assign any work” but what are we as students supposed to do with this? Go to class on Monday, then just lounge around awaiting our inevitable Thursday classes and increased workload to make up for “study break”?

The only link I could find to submit my direct feedback is the link above. Should you be disappointed, outraged, etc., use the measly google forms the administration has given us to let them know how you feel. I would not be surprised if these just go to some random inbox to get ignored, but at least we can try **something** other than a useless change.org form.

I don’t know if I’m in the minority here, or if I’m getting upset over nothing but it just feels like I have no voice here, no student body who represents how I actually feel, and no way to tell this administration how awful their decision here is for students who suffer from seasonal depression, or who are currently looking at yet another semester of an awful “Zoom University”

However, if all of your classes are online currently, an off campus apartment would be much better. You can have a kitchen, your own bathroom (or maybe share with one other person), and in some complexes your own laundry unit. Off campus is usually a lot cheaper if you’re willing to live a 10 minute drive away as well. I think it’s much quieter and more spacious than the dorms (depending on where you’re living). Because there aren’t as many public spaces in these apartments, it’s less likely for transmission too.

That being said, the Chandler Rd/Abbott Rd apartments are “nice” and cheaper, but be ready to deal with bad management and lack of customer service; it’s student housing so don’t expect perfection...There are trade offs but having your own apartment is much preferable, at least in my experience.

You can take advantage of crisis counseling, download a virtual care kit and seek consultation services, among many other programs. Please, reach out if you need support or a listening ear. If you need immediate help, our crisis hotline is available 24/7: Dial 517-355-8270 and press ""1"" to be connected with a crisis counselor.""

Of course, in reality, those 2 days will be spent doing absolutely none of any of that by most students.

Since practically everything is currently online and you could do most things remotely, this is not as big of a factor this year. You do pay a pretty penny for the locational convenience, so if you don’t have classes in person and they only have a few cafs open, you could theoretically live a little further out at a place like Abbot for *much less* and not be as inconvenienced to go to class in person like a normal year.",0.6798,0.2976,0.0226

I would say the fact they are making housing not mandatory would mean you don't necessarily need to live on campus this spring semester. Now if you have the means to afford it, then I would recommend it for least freshmen year and maybe part of sophomore year. But junior/senior/recent alum (they can't live on campus anyway lol), then I would say getting an off campus apartment is probably better.

I agree with the person who said that Brody is far because you only get one bus for that neighborhood and it only travels to East neighborhood so if you live there and you need to go somewhere that’s closer to the north or south, then you would have to take the bus and then stop at the Cata station and take ANOTHER bus which takes too much time.

I would advise anywhere other than Brody. That may be an unpopular opinion but it’s so far from everything and you basically have to take a bus anywhere. 

Also it doesn’t matter where you live at the end of the day. Busses go everywhere and if you really want to, you can walk anywhere no matter where your classes are. 

I would try to tailor your living experience more on your style. Which includes dining, bathroom style, room size.

Class location isn’t too much to worry about because most of the time you’re out and about and your classes are back to back. It depends on your schedule but I’d doubt you would go to class, go back to your room, then go to class, then go back to your room.....

I also would like to add that I had a meeting with my advisor for something completely different, but she asked me about the midterm for this course bc she was being sent tons of emails about it, and one thing that was brought up was the TAs. I told her that it would be more helpful if the TAs were closer to our age, or maybe a little closer to us in experience level? I don't know if what I'm saying makes sense but what I mean is that, having TAs that are wayyyyy more experienced might actually make it more difficult for them to come down to our level and help us from a pov of someone who may have never seen this type of code, or has no coding experience. Like it might make it easier for them to teach us if they could reason with us better. Because it definitely feels like the TAs are frustrated with us, or when they speak to us it makes us feel like we should've known what to do or the error.

The government is an institution that holds the exclusive right to use force. I believe that the only proper use of force is retaliatory force in response to someone else who has already initiated force upon you. Thus, governmental force should only be used to protect individuals from other individuals who wish to initiate force.

You argued that government intervention can lead to better products and to you, that is freedom. I could argue every point and say why I think more intervention leads to worse products but that is beside the point. All government intervention is some force against someone and the person being forced is losing their freedom. Anyone who benefits from this has not gained freedom, just like how a thief does not gain freedom by robbing someone else. Everything that benefits you does not gain you more freedom, freedom is only gained by removing force.

The government is just an institution of force and when this force is not being used to protect peoples freedom, it is taking away someones freedom. The issue for me is not small vs big government but proper vs improper government.

Even with a vaccine there is very little chance of the virus no longer being an issue within a year from now, but I didn't want to speculate so I added on an extra year.

I fail to see how that's violent, or an infringement of anyone's rights in particular, but OK.

14765,"You should drop out of 431 and take it another semester. 

I took it with Liu in the spring, and it was pretty much a waste of time. We basically went over 331 for half of the semester (we went over all the sorting algorithms in painfully slow speed, trees, graphs, etc), talked about proofs for more of it, talked _about AI_ (not how to implement it or anything, just the things it can do), then finally got to new content in the last three or four weeks of the class. I think the only things I learned about were selection problems (e.g. MOM select), P-NP problems, and flow networks, all of which you can learn about yourself in the [free textbook we used for class](https://algorithms.wtf). You could probably learn these three things in a few hours of reading the textbook.

We had _one_ programming assignment the entire semester, in a class about algorithms. The rest of the assignments were written, and honestly quite tedious -- the first few were just proofs, but we ended up having to make really big trees and other data structures on paper/in word documents and do a bunch of iterations (by hand) of some given algorithm. 

Granted, this was the first time he has ever taught 431, but I am truly disappointed I took this class with him instead of with another instructor that I've heard great things about (regarding how they teach 431). I am not the only one that shares this sentiment, and for context, I got near or over a 100% in the class and showed up to every single lecture even once we moved to online zooms, so I'm not just a disgruntled student who got a bad score and is angry at the professor.

Liu seems like a nice and knowledgeable dude, and the grading we had was fair, we just spent wayyy too long on pretty much every concept -- for instance, we went over ""Gauss' Problem"" for like 4-5 classes at least (which is about a week and a half), for basically no reason. We also had a section of the class where he asked us what we wanted to learn, which I thought was weird. 

If your main goal is a 4.0 and not the interesting parts of 431, then this is probably a good class for you. However, prepare to be bored and potentially not learn much useful information. It is possible that Liu has revamped his curriculum, but I kind of doubt that.",0.1647,0.4119,0.4234

I know it's hard, but if we want to continue to keep it this low we need to keep up the precautions. Also, I know we're all desensitized, but 50 preventable deaths in a day is bad. Of course, most days aren't as bad as that. The current average COVID death rate per day in Michigan is 26 ([source](https://covidactnow.org/us/mi/?s=1231303)), which is the highest it's been since June. That is even higher than the average number of traffic fatalities per day in Michigan (\~20) ([source](https://www.michigan.gov/documents/mdot/MDOT_Moving_Michigan_Toward_Zero_Deaths_Brochure_481562_7.pdf)).   


2. In the data you linked to, it looks like Sparrow and McLaren are both at \~77%. I agree that that's not 100%, but given the way exponential growth curves work I'd still say it's on the concerning side. If we don't keep transmission at a steady or decreasing rate, we could blow past 100% very quickly.

We're all in close contact with each other behind the line and see each other every day more or less, so if one of us catches it...well, we all will probably get it, and I have no idea how the store would stay open if that happens.

""Freedom is the absence of physical coercion."" The government requiring businesses to not pollute the water that runs to your house via regulation \*IS\* protecting you from force being used against you. You didn't ask Dupont or 3M to fill your water with PFOS.

The government requiring food companies to have certain health standards \*IS\* using its force to protect people from an entity that wishes to use ""force"" against them.

Let's say you break your leg - total accident, slipped off your porch shoveling snow. No one used force against you. You need pain medication. You are a taxpayer (also, presumably, a human person). You go to the doctor who prescribes medication. You can trust that the doctor knows what s/he's doing because of regulations requiring him/her not to ""use force"" against you and prescribe bad medicine that they get kickbacks from. You know that the medication is safe because of regulations preventing bad entities from ""using force"" and not testing a cocktail of harmful snake oil to sell for profit.

""I could argue every point and say why I think more intervention leads to worse products but that is beside the point. All government intervention is some force against someone and the person being forced is losing their freedom.""

I have rephrased my arguments in your terms. Also ""I could argue that more intervention leads to worse products"" is patently False. You are wrong my friend. A quick read through of ""The Jungle"" or the history of thalidomide, PFOS, etc. will show that.

Additionally - and this is an opinion - the concept of needing 100% freedom 100% of the time unless you are explicitly, immediately doing direct harm to another person is ridiculous. You're required to have car insurance so that if you're in a crash you aren't bankrupted by the costs, or YOUR force harming someone else doesn't bankrupt THEM because you refuse to cover (or are unable to cover) their expenses. You are required via regulation to wear a seatbelt while driving a car to prevent your death, but also to prevent others from killing you. You are required to prove you are capable of driving a motor vehicle before you are allowed to use one.

All of those things infringe upon your freedom - I'll concede that - but they do so to make our society safer. They are required BEFORE an action is done because having them after the fact is useless, and history tells us that if they aren't in place we have worse outcomes (more injuries, more death, more bankruptcy, etc.)

Secondly, although I will say that once you have everything sorted out financially it will/should go pretty well, I’m also having issues with that as of the moment. This is moreso something that I’m currently dealing with as opposed to a general issue, but long story short MSU reported different course hours to the VA than they did to me so now the VA is expecting me to pay back over $2000 for course hours I was never enrolled in. To make it worse, now the MSU Veterans Office of course won’t answer to any of my messages so I’m stuck until they decide to pick up the phone.

Personally I decided to stay on campus because I felt it would work best for me but honestly I don’t feel like it would make that much of a difference in terms of your benefits.

I understand that sarcastically dismissing an argument without providing a source is hot right now, but I’ll take you up on that invitation. 

Direct quote from the article

&gt;no nursing homes were *forced* to take COVID-19 residents, Gordon [director of MDHHS] said

Allowing is an important distinction from forcing, don’t you think?

While we’re at it, I think I’ll just dump some statistics from the article down here:

&gt;	Among every 1,000 residents in Michigan, 69 died of COVID through August — a rate that falls between the highest death rate — New York’s at 180.2 deaths per 1,000 residents, and the lowest — Alaska’s at 5.7 deaths per 1,000 residents.

&gt;Michigan’s proportion of nursing home deaths among all COVID-19 deaths falls below the national average — 33.2 percent, compared to 38.6 percent nationally.

&gt;In the week ended Aug. 23, 1.8 percent of Michigan nursing homes had three or more confirmed COVID cases, compared to 4.7 percent nationally.

&gt;In Michigan, a lower percentage of residents in specially assigned regional hubs that accepted COVID patients died from the virus than did residents in other nursing homes — 17 percent, compared to 26 percent.

So I guess Michigan Nursing homes aren’t exactly the Mayo Clinic, but they aren’t the liberal death camps you’re making them out to be either.

While we’re on the topic of agency, going to a popular crowded bar is an entirely optional activity and the people who did so contributed to a minimum of 51 confirmed cases according to the [Lansing State Journal](https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/2020/06/25/confirmed-covid-19-cases-tied-harpers-outbreak-reach-43/3258485001/)

I'm personally a data nerd and I spend a lot of time everyday reading analysis from election/political nerds for fun, and both groups of people tend to understand that we're working with probabilities and percentages here instead of certainties so I'm not going to celebrate yet... But we have 4 years of data showing that Trump was a deeply unpopular president who never particularly gained any bumps or added major support to his coalition from any group besides non-college white males (who were already in his camp to begin with). No one is happy with how covid was/is being handled, and I don't think Trump's message of pretending that we already beat covid is particularly going to land with many groups outside of the ones already there.  Dems have addressed two of the biggest issues that were plaguing them in '16 including low Dem turnout/enthusiasm as well as catching up on the middle ground vote with someone people tend to find likable.

Edit: In response to the above comment asking if we ""really believe the entire world is doomed due to climate change if Trump is president"" and the rest of it. 

We do not believe the Earth is doomed due to climate change if Trump is president. We know the Earth is doomed if we don't take significant measures to reduce our impacts - Joe Biden wants to fix the problem. Donald Trump calls it a hoax. 

People are saying that Trump being reelected will kill them - this is unfortunate and terrifying. There is a president who has encouraged so much division, racism, and violence that people are rightfully terrified of his getting four more years. 

She is tired of people complaining bout the US where we have so much privilege. I agree, we have a lot of privilege. And our response shouldn't be to hurt others from our point of privilege. Our goals shouldn't be to prevent others from bettering themselves, or putting them down for doing so. We can simultaneously be a wealthy, privileged country with problems. We can be doing better than other countries and still strive to be better. That's not whining, that's American.",0.0229,0.1502,0.8269

I’m worried that with whomever wins my job chances and public opinion towards my major/career are in jeopardy. On one hand, if Trump wins, being a CJ major will only make me become a public target of scrutiny and be branded as “racist” if I become a cop or work in some sort of aspect in public safety. Furthermore, most police unions have backed Trump which is something I cannot get my head around. This means that they support his violent rhetoric. On the other hand, if Biden wins and implements the mass police reform WE CURRENTLY NEED, there might not be any public safety jobs due to budget cuts/reform. Right now, I don’t even know what to do as a career and feel as though the CJ field I grew up admiring and was proud of has now spiraled into a dumpster fire where no one can win. It’s gotten to the point where I have considered becoming a teacher or working in the private security field.

I’m also worried about election violence. I don’t publicly disclose my political views (I’m a moderate but voted straight-party Democrat this election) to a lot of my close friends (for fear of targeting) but they keep talking about how they are “prepared” for whatever happens from the “far-left.” This preparedness worries me that if Trump loses there will be some sort of armed conflict. Maybe not in East Lansing, but in other parts across the country. I’ve already prepared that if shit hits the fan here, I will head home for the foreseeable future where I am away from civilization and can defend myself if necessary.

Both candidates have corruption, there’s corruption within all of politics as well as big corp. Both have really bad allegations, but aren’t proven entirely. While I share views from both parties, at this present time I’m more for Trumps policies and how he handles the economy, jobs, foreign affairs, gun laws, etc. With over 40 years in politics, Biden doesn’t have anything to go off of and he just seems like a pawn in the democrat party. I would have much rather seen Bernie be running against Trump because I feel like Bernie at least has validity. That being said, If Biden wins I’ll get over it and move on with my life cause I have more important things to worry about. Also, I wish the left would act more tolerant towards others viewpoints and opinions. I’ve been called racist, whore, slut, bitch, fucked up, etc etc just because I’m supporting Trump. It sucks, but I’m not changing my opinion just to cater to my peers.

I mean, there is only one team called the Patriots, so that's not really an open question. He's also gray. However I can find you plenty of examples of nonwhite's being projected as a patriot, even in some cases through propaganda. White supremacist's might try to call themselves patriot, but it doesn't redefine the word. Patriot is just someone who loves their country. Currently, a lot of Americans won't use the word patriot to describe themselves, but that doesn't mean the proud boys can claim it for themselves.

Ronald Regan is a great example of implanting a taxation on capital gains correctly, without having a massive effect on the market. However, there will always be a massive gain in capital gain realization that could lead to changes in market behavior temporarily. My theory that the market would sink does not take into accountability that Biden will try and offset the market. Could he, sure, but even the 2012 pullback is a recent example of a tax hike without an offsetting factor to satisfy the market. The reason I say Regan did this successfully, is because stocks continued to surge after his gains tax because of his massive tax cuts, otherwise known as Reganomics.

Edit: Also a pullback doesn’t mean a stock market crash. It’s likely the pullback will be temporary. I never stated this as a bad thing either, rather I am just pointing out what could happen. In fact it is quite healthy for markets to have pullbacks, and it is up to the consumer to obtain capital gains realization before the tax plan is implemented.

Now reviewing my previous article economic growth relies heavily on gdp. If the economists theory’s come True, gdp could tick lower than expected. But again economics relies heavily on trials. So, only time can really answer your question correctly. But, I will say that the market is never happy about tax’s on captain gains or trades, so I would expect a retaliation there. And really economics is a balance on social growth or economic growth, solving societies problems can lead to decreases in economic growth and vice versa. That’s the problem the world faces with its vast limited resources.

15607,"Not trying to defend MSU's lack of IT security, but the issue is actually slightly more complicated (especially with remote learning). There are three major aspects of data security that I observe in this example: 1. how did this email not get marked as spam, 2. how do we ensure malicious 3rd parties don't use MSU accounts, 3. how do we ensure phishing attacks don't look legitimate.

&amp;#x200B;

Regarding the first (1) point, spam filters are in place to prohibit malicious hyperlinks and known phishing attacks. If you send an email regarding a giveaway to a MSU account, more likely than not it will end up in spam. However, as MSU has many RSOs and other affiliations that will often do giveaways and other job opportunities, internal emails that are from [msu.edu](https://msu.edu) are not flagged as frequently (as sending from a [msu.edu](https://msu.edu) email provides a high trust factor). Hypothetically, one could reduce the trust factor for students while increasing the trust factor for professors, but this becomes complicated when you consider RSOs, ULAs (ugrad), TAs (grad) and 'professors' (as a PhD program). Additionally, what happens if an undergraduate works in a position that sends similar emails that would likely be marked as spam - such as CORE - or a professor that happens to be taking continuing education at MSU. Overall, this tier system introduces a ton of complexity and may lead to a decrease in MSU business operations. 

For the second point, as internal MSU emails provide a higher initial trust factor and thus are more likely to be able to send spam, how can we secure the approximate \~270,000 MSU accounts in MSU's system? The obvious solution that comes to hand is, of course, two factor verification which MSU does support but does not force for non-employees. All MSU employees, including student employees, are required to have two-factor verification enabled. This is mandated as MSU EBS, which is MSU payroll information system, requires 2FA and it is required for you sign into EBS to configure direct deposit information. Although, the 2FA system (which isn't my department) is slightly weird. Students employees must configure MSU 2FA but don't need it to sign into non-business functions (e.g. StuInfo, O365, etc.). Something that could increase the security would be to enable a MSU 2FA requirement for O365 for anyone that has 2FA enabled. But this is controversial as 2FA disadvantages those without cellular devices - pushing MSU's requirement for a computer was controversial and subject to tons of debate. Now, imagine: MSU requires a cellular device too? This isn't positive PR and the university needs a good brand perception to sell education as a product (tuition).  

&amp;#x200B;

To add more to point two, could we limit connections to known locations? To be honest, maybe but it's complicated. MSU, as it stands, allows connections to your account from anywhere in the world. If you travel to Russia or China today (please don't, stay inside), you'll be able to sign into MSU's account systems without problem. This is because MSU has a large and diverse population that is engaged in distanced learning everywhere. It is very common for people to be in East Lansing, MI one day and then three days later to sign from Beijing, China. Students travel, the community is large and diverse - what if a family member died and you needed to immediate visit. What if it's a study abroad and you need to access course material. You can sign in to your MSU from almost anywhere (sections exist, Iran currently is blocking [auth.msu.edu](https://auth.msu.edu), North Korea IP ranges are not allowed either, etc. but generally, anywhere is OK). What MSU could do is implement a system similar to credit cards: if you're leaving Michigan or your specified location from MSU StuInfo (or EBS), disallow connections. etc...

I just transferred this semester from WMU majoring in SCM. I had a 3.8 GPA with 56 Credits transferring in.

You need to have competitive grades (3.0 or above) in your Business Prereqs and you need ALL of them completed otherwise you cannot transfer as ""Business Admitted"" rather your would be ""Business Preference"" which sets you back a semester.

The one class I did not have was the CSE 102 class which is only offered at MSU. The way I got around this was taking a CSE 231 equivalent class at a local community college over the summer.

To answer your question, It is not to late to apply for next fall, but you will be set back if you do not have all the prereqs and are forced to transfer as ""Business Preference"".

Edit: As mentioned below by another user, If you transfer with 56+ credits (Junior Classification) and are not admitted as ""Business Admitted"", you are not allowed to be admitted as a ""Business Preference"" Major because it is not a degree granting major. You would be required to switch to a non-business major, where you could then apply your first semester at MSU to become a ""Business Admitted"" Major.

MSU has said they will keep all records of students academic transcripts and you can get them at any time upon request. My future employer requires a 3.0 GPA minimum so if I was in a situation where I had a 2.5 in some class I would take that S instead and if they want to further review the transcript then they can ask you for a full report and you can get that to them easily. That being said unless you're looking to go to Law School or some other extremely competitive job or institution after graduation I suggest taking a 3.5, it will give you a good buffer if you have other classes you perform poorly in.

15962,"Freshman here

1.) If you don’t already have connections to people on campus, fairly minimal. I’ve made friends through my program, but they’re all at home unfortunately. Point is, not many people are looking to meet new people at the moment. And with a lot of upperclassmen being on campus who already have friends, this is made a bit tougher. As for the people within the dorms, I can’t speak for everyone, but with my major I essentially spend 80% of the day in my room doing homework or studying. 

2) I do see some people socializing occasionally. When it was warmer, I’d sometimes see some people throwing a frisbee, or sitting in a circle outside. But as for covid safety, it really depends on the group. Some people blatantly disregard guidelines, while others don’t. For the most part, we’ve been doing well from a covid standpoint(after the frat house issue, that is). 

Also, the early-detection program is really good. If you’re not aware of what that is, it’s where participants spit into a vial every week, and send it in to get analyzed for covid traces. They usually email you the results within 48 hours. Pretty much a free covid test, so that’s offered me a sense of relief. 

3.) I don’t have a link to the actual, written policies, but iirc you just have to always be wearing a mask. Elevators are limit one per person, but there’s honestly enough room in there for two people to be spaced out. If I ever run into someone in an elevator I’m wanting to use, I’ll just ask if they feel comfortable with me joining them. If not, cool, I just wait for the next one. Also, I don’t believe you can have any overnight guests. 

4.) Honestly, the living situation is fantastic... But has drawbacks. It’s wonderful because it’s a suite-style dorm, which normally houses two people. This means you get an extra desk, twice the dresser space, and your own bathroom that would normally be used by four people(you two and the people next door). So to answer your question, yes. It’s just single occupancy rooms, with every other room being empty. That being said, it can get really lonely. My hope is that next semester I’ll be seeing some of my classmates on campus, but for the moment I do miss the company I had at home. 

Also, being in the south neighborhood(especially the hall I’m in) you get to hear trains pass a LOT. They’re loud asf.",0.7778,0.1946,0.0276

16015,"“ASMSU” did not vote in favor of the recommendation, “ASMSU” is not one person. As far as I know, the GA found out about the recommendation the same time everyone else did. It’s not fair to say ASMSU “voted” for something when one person voted for it in a committee of several faculty members and a grad student, whether the GA voted for this person or not, that doesn’t mean they consented to a decision like this. 

Even if you do consider them voting her in as the entire organization wanting to take away SB, the current VPAA was the sole person running for the position in the last election, so Im not sure what you would’ve wanted the GA to do. 

I think you’re missing the point that this was something that would’ve happened whether the singular person in a committee said yes or no, most other schools have made this same decision. ASMSU has said their person in the committee voted in favor of it, nobody is omitting that they did, they’ve admitted to their hand in it. However, I think blaming an administration that gets paid millions vs blaming one person who makes like $12 an hour over a decision ultimately made by admin is far more fair. 

ASMSU just passed a bill for the 4-day weekend because they understand that having only 2 days off wouldn’t actually give students a break, this is under the recommended limit of a 5 day break, and is the most feasible option. 

Asmsu is not one big conspiracy against students, they are students who, for the most part, are unpaid and are working their asses off to do what’s best for all students. If you don’t like the way it’s being ran then I beg you to do something about it, go to their meetings and make a public comment, apply for a position, email your representative, come up with your own bill to magically fix everything and make everyone happy.",0.0802,0.4467,0.4731

AL333 is a great class to try it out. Definitely recommend it with professor McArdle. 

I recommend delving a little into UX on the side though, if you are wanting to do something with UX. Dunno if this was just from my class lineup, haven't yet had to learn Adobe Xd or a few other prototyping softwares that many jobs ask for experience in, so consider supplementing your homework and assignments with things like that. They aren't hard to learn, but it's a good skill to have. Every homework assignment you do will basically help build a great portfolio and learn skills needed for the field.

There's a ton of papers, but they're all only 1 or 2 pages so it's not THAT bad and you don't have to do all of them. Exams are open note and quite easy if you did the coursework. 

The only difference between the regular section and the honors section, at least with him as prof, is that we have to read 3 books (that he chooses) over the course of the entire semester, write a one page response to literally anything in them for each, and join a 1 hour long zoom call to discuss each one. We just finished the second book and are about to begin the third.

The class itself isn't SUPER easy considering just the amount of time you have to put in, but the honors credit is a piece of cake compared to most and almost everything I've done for this class has been incredibly interesting.

The court can challenge whether or not we are in a state of emergency, however it is within the jurisdiction of the MDHSS (as per Michigan’s constitution) to enact executive orders in times where a pandemic occurs. 

It is this way because of how slow legislation moves. Similarly, the executive branch can declare war if deemed an emergency situation (9/11) without congress’s approval. 

Later, the courts can rule if the policy was made in times of an actual emergency, or if the specific policy addresses the need effectively, or if the policy is still necessary by revaluation.

If you look further into my previous comment, and want to do some research of your own, it even includes the level in which local police officers can enforce these policies and issue citations or misdemeanors based on E.O. from the MDHHS in a pandemic if people aren’t following the policies to curb the pandemic (spoiler alert: they can).",0.0422,0.5456,0.4121

16307,"Both the original order and an extension are arguable in court and can be dismantled by a court ruling. Whitmer cannot use the MDHHS as a puppet just as the president can't use the CDC as a puppet, they cannot be ordered to issue something like an emergency order. That being said Whitmer does reserve the right to threaten to fire the director of the MDHHS if they don't do what she wants them to do. Honestly though, she appointed the guy for a reason so he's likely to play ball with her and do what he's told. 

To your not about constitutional powers of government within an emergency on the federal level, the argument can be made that a lockdown is violating those same rights as well as others. An executive order by the president for a national lockdown would be challenged in court as many would argue that it violates their 1st and 10th amendment rights. Depending on how the court rules that order would stand or be struck down as government overreach. The same thing happens at the state level which is why you saw the courts strike down Whitmers orders. 

The MDHHS is not making policies, only legislators have the power to enact policy. Policies are voted on and permanent unless repealed. A emergency order is not policy nor should it be consTrued as one, enforcement of emergency orders is to the discretion of local governments resources (East Lansing PD for example). As I said, the guidelines set by the CDC example is what would be used as legal argument.

A pandemic isn't bound to a time. Therefore, it is the court's decision on if the pandemic still poses enough of a threat to justify these orders, or if the pandemic isn't a significant threat.

The  statue has been here since the late 1970s or early 1980s.  The Meijer  store originally used animal statues to mark parking lot sections in  order to help customers remember where they parked.  When the store  switched to letter signs instead, the giraffe was saved and moved to  where it is now.  The other animal statues were either sold or donated  to individuals.  These statues may have come from a carnival that was  located nearby.  [https://www.roadarch.com/critters/mam5.html](https://www.roadarch.com/critters/mam5.html)

Party of 12

Also the nonsensical rules such as Cuomo in NY ordering gyms and restaurants with liquor licenses to close at 10 pm starting this past Friday... it seems nonsensical because 
1) the virus doesn’t wait to 10 pm to effect people and while I get that the hours after 10 will now limit social contacts many people will be trying to utilize gyms and restaurants before 10pm possibly causing more people in an area than would be if they had longer business hours
2) instead of making the rule be that the sale alcohol be stopped at 10pm he’s forcing the entire business to close which really hurts the bottom line of the restaurant and the staff
3) but again Both the governor himself and his brother, Chris, have been spotted numerous times breaking his own rules more recently Chris Cuomo was spotted in a salon getting a hair cut while refusing to were a mask which was also seen with Nancy Pelosi over the summer while salons weren’t even permitted to be open in San Francisco... just “rules for thee but not for me”",0.0117,0.1426,0.8457

16431,"It's going to be a challenge to get a prescription as an adult, but not impossible. There are certain protocols (Michigan Laws as a schedule II drug?)  that have to occur in order for this to happen. Meeting with your physician and describing your symptoms is the first step. From there, they will recommend a neurophysiologist to complete an evaluation. If they diagnose you with ADHD, they will then determine if it is impairing you enough that specific strategies and skills cannot provide coping mechanisms.  


Be mindful, adderall cannot help you suddenly have the motivation for work, nor is it a miracle drug. My first experience with it was when I was a first year teacher. I could not keep up with my ADHD and 30 students causing chaos led to actual mental lock ups where I just could not process what was happening around me. The drug helped me tunnel my focus into one thing at a time in order to complete the day.  It's also something you cannot turn off once its in your body. My actual first day, I went from 8 AM to 2 AM cleaning my house. I even took a washcloth to the metal brackets on the inside of my freezer. I could not stop focusing on cleaning my house...  


  
Adderall will also increase your stress levels, heart rate, and can make you unreasonably irritable. Like, you will know you are wrong, but that will piss you off more until you lash out at someone. By the end of the day, you will be exhausted, and you may find yourself having less mental compacity at 4PM on adderall than you would at 8AM off of it.  


Lastly, look into connections with long-term usage of Adderall and dementia, and know the risk.  


  
I originally did not want to take any drug to help myself manage my ADHD. However, my blood pressure, heart rate, and anxiety at the time was so high my doctor said my options were:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Die of a heart attack before 40
2. Live a happier life and risk onset dementia at 60 (if I have to be on the drug long-term.)

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, I have found balance and took myself off of Adderall. I would not have been able to cope for my first few years teaching without it though.

Schools want to see evidence of academic success and research potential. If it’s been a few years since you’ve graduated, it may be more difficult for them to evaluate your academic background - especially if you opted for an S in any relevant courses.

This is where what you did in between really matters. If your work experience since graduating shows a strong understanding of the relevant material for the program, then that may be enough to overcome any gaps in your transcript. Also, work experience can typically help provided evidence of your ability to conduct research, even if actual research experience is usually better. 

Note that this advice is tailored towards PhD programs, as Master’s programs are typically not funded and aren’t really worth it unless your career specifically requires it. In this case there’s usually a more direct path to your masters through your career (I am unfamiliar with this, but I know it’s fairly common in finance-type careers).",0.2714,0.5955,0.1331

16567,"Ok, let me start out by saying I’m not happy with how this semester has gone in terms of the quality of education or how MSU has handled all items related to the pandemic. **However**, I will defend them somewhat. 


Firstly, MSU did wait till the last minute to move classes online. I believe it was actually because MSU started later than other schools, and they wanted to see how well those who brought students back did. As in, they wanted to see if it come be done safely, as well as done safely and in a financially affordable way. When the first few schools opened, and had booming COVID-19 cases, I think it pushed MSU’s Board into having online classes. And I do believe that it is safer and more responsible to have online classes. 

To your second point, as someone else has mentioned, those issues lay within the Athletics’ Department and their budget. That budget is completely separate from MSU(in terms of student tuitions and education), and is generated through mainly TV contracts and ticket revenue. However, the pandemic obviously has removed all ticket revenue from MSU Athletics, and the almost took away all of their TV Revenue money as well. Our athletic department budget has been roughly $140 million last few years, with about $80 coming from TV Deals. As I said in another comment, the cost of renovating the pool was going to be significantly large, and the fact the swimming and diving is a non revenue generating sports, it couldn’t justify the funding. And a side note, MSU leaves the lights on the Jumbotron because it keeps them warm in the winter which prevents the bulbs from breaking or going out. It’s much much cheaper to light it up a lot than have bulbs replaced. 

Finally regarding S/NS, I simply think the university didn’t want to do it. I too was disappointed that they did not announce much sooner, as it would have save us all a lot of stress. I believe MSU did not want to bring back S/NS but had to once the semester passed midterms as they could see the vast difficulties students were having in these online classes. It was brought back not by choice, but by necessity. 

Again, just my opinion, and I would love to hear other Spartans’ responses. Good luck everyone the rest of the way!",0.1556,0.5189,0.3255

These are important questions: how many people do you mean by some? Do you know if they have been careful, too? How many of your family members are at risk, and will you be in close contact with all of them? If you're not sure about the friends you saw being cautious, you might consider only seeing some of your family members or not going altogether, depending on how you answer these questions. And even if your friends have been careful, there's still a risk they were exposed.

It's incredibly sucky to have to consider not seeing our families for the holidays, but that's what pandemics call for sometimes, especially when numbers are up. I say this not to be rude nor am I patronizing or 'scolding' you, but you made the choice to see friends, and that's what put you in this situation.

The question asks if you’ve had exposure to someone whom has tested positive for COVID-19 or has symptoms (and is a PUA). Exposure specifically is defined as at least 15 minutes of being within 6 feet of the individual. So unless you’ve been around someone with a positive test or symptoms, you do not meet criteria for exposure.

16973,"I think you need to be mindful of speaking for a group of other people. Though I understand, your sentiment, I am not sure it’s coming off as you are intending.

Your evidence as a family with many IEPs does provide you with insight into how the educational process can provide different resources for those who may need it. However it is important to use anecdotal evidence sparingly. I know you recognized it doesn’t mean  you know more (I am not trying to compare here) but it might be easy to see patterns, or make assumptions that are too narrow.

I am not going to say my students aren’t preforming (on paper) better online, because they are. But we have to be mindful as to why. You hit the nail on the head however, which is that parent can provide a more 1-1 ratio of support to their students. That is - if the parent is able. This is where a lot of privilege can play out. Parents who are able to use extra time off work can give supports to boost students who need it. Those who can’t, perform worse than in person by far. Additionally, we can’t know how much parents are supporting, and if the students are actually retaining knowledge.

None of this however helps those students in college who, for the first time, may be experiencing a life without the support of parents. It can be especially hard if they are first generation college students.

This whole conversation is based on generalizations on both sides. But I recognized that. Many of my statement comes from working in an education field for years however and while I don’t act know everything, I have worked with over 600 families on these things, and have spent my career keeping up on these topics. I fully understand that these statements do not cover everything - which is my point. Not every student who is complaining about online learning is doing so by blaming their professors. Sure, some are, but some of these voices really do need help and to be heard.",0.0768,0.4481,0.4752

Lastly, as you yourself had previously stated, students aren’t the only ones on this sub. Some people here use this as the East Lansing subreddit.

Additionally, online learning can actually have negative effect on the learning of students with ADHD. I wouldn’t generalize too much, but it’s important to recognize that ADHD has three types: inattentive, compulsive, and combined. For inattentive students, online learning allows for the mind to wander a lot more than when the learning is forced and in front of them. It does however allow students a chance to get up and walk around, which is one strategy most people with ADHD rely on. This really only works is the learning is a flipped style and at the student’s pace. For students with impulse control, I would foresee them struggling with not getting off on a tangent and resisting things like social media, games, etcetera. For students with combined type, well, they’re obviously going to have the worst time. Which I can empathize with since I have ADHD combined.

ADD is an out-dated term.

Autism has such a wide range of needs, I am not going to even try to make sense of their ability to perform online versus offline. I have had some students who I can probably excel much more online than in person, while others rely on the social environment to keep them on top of their work. This is likely due to ADHD being incredibly prevalent with those diagnosed with Autism.

Anyway, having parents critique my practice can be frustrating at times. However, most educators actually see these criticisms as honing their skills. It helps to build a picture of what the classroom looks from the student’s perspective. This helps build an effective learning environment. MSU is an educational institution, designed to help students develop higher level cognitive thinking. It is not a screener to weed out the frail and weak.",0.0952,0.3937,0.5111

However, I honestly feel as though my understanding of the material improved. After the (horrific and thankfully brief) transition period, only one prof taught the online course for all 80+ sections. She made the videos, and the other profs had different tasks - mine became the person in charge of the quizzes I believe. I honestly feel as though her instruction was more thorough in less words and that I got a better professor outta the deal, at least for my learning style. Plus, even though the quizzes were insanely difficult, they were open note and you got 2 tries. I preferred it over cramming for an in-person exam, despite them being frequent and probably harder due to the format. 

Hopefully someone in it this semester is lurking and can give insight into how they taught the course this fall. IDK if it's changed since the online transition last spring, but I'm sure it has in at least a few ways.",0.5991,0.316,0.085

I 4.0 both classes but 232 definitely took more note taking, googling, and time on the projects and even weekly homework to get right. This is my opinion looking back at it but both were difficult in there own way.

I'm not huge on partying or anything but I was incredibly afraid of the floor being anti-social and me not being able to make friends and it had on edge for a long time in high school on what to choose. Eventually, I just went for honors and it was a great choice. First of all, according to my friends I had on other floors of the building, the honors floor seemed to be one of the most social floors. Second of all, the people on that floor generally are in similar advanced classes that you might be in, and being able to get help and collaborate on classes is a great help.

We all got to talking on day 1 after moving in, went to snyphi that night for dinner, and the rest is history. Called ourselves the freemasons (thanks Avery). They were my first group of friends, and I wouldn't trade them for anything.

All in all, it really made freshman year easier to be surrounded by other people from the honors college, and I honestly think honors housing is one of the best perks of being a member, up there with gen. ed. substitutions.
