306,"&gt;First, you're not understanding what I'm saying. I'm saying that we don't know if people who are *vaccinated* are spreading the virus as quickly as those who aren't. I've read about how shitty it is, I've also read about how my chances of going to the hospital or dying (no matter the variant) are incredibly low, so I think I'll survive. Of the 168 million people who have gotten the vaccine, 0.00004 have gotten covid with only 19% of 0.00004 dying. 

So you recognize the utility of universal vaccination in a congregate setting, and the interest served in mandating it, no?

 (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html). On average 90% of those 65 and up have been vaccinated in the United States, so please don't give me the ol' ""you're killing everyone's grandparents!""

120,000 people under 65 are dead as well...

&gt;&amp;#x200B;
&gt;
&gt;Moral of the story, if you're at risk, get the vaccine and you'll be incredibly safe. If you are at risk and you don't, you're gonna get covid. The scientists actually doing science and not spending 90% of their time on TV fear mongering do not expect this to ever be completely gone.

""This virus has killed 600,000+ people, so you should get vaccinated and cover your face"" is not fear mongering. ""The vaccine is going to give me autism and make my skin magnetic and big pharma is going to track me with microchips"" is fear-mongering. Of course it's never going to go away. The ""owie mask hurt facey"" crowd is too large.

&gt;Oh and the mask efficiency rates are from the CDC's brand new data, so unless they're giving misleading data (which they definitely have never done) then its probably right.

&gt;1.) No one knows how transmissible though, and it's looking like its far lower anyway. 

That isn't True at all, Delta is now by far the predominant strain and carries an estimated r₀ of 5 and 9 (about as contagious as chickenpox). B.1.1.7 was around 3-4, and wild type was even less.

&gt;2.) Yes, vaccines work very well. Although, for most people &lt;65, that extra clinical significance is still insignificant, no?

Even if severe illness *exclusively* affects people over 65, you and anyone else can still transmit the virus to them. And if you've never had severe pneumonia or been intubated before, I suggest reading about how much it sucks even if you *do* survive.

&gt;3.) masks are 40-60% effective at keeping you from spreading it, while only 20-30% effective at protecting you from it. Those aren't trivial numbers, just adding extra info. https://context-cdn.washingtonpost.com/notes/prod/default/documents/54f57708-a529-4a33-9a44-b66d719070d9/note/753667d6-8c61-495f-b669-5308f2827155.#page=1

By your own estimates, which are quite conservative as most studies peg the effectiveness higher, the joint reduction in transmission between two masked people is between 52 and 72%, which is exceptional for how unobtrusive it is to wear a piece of cloth over your mouth. Pair that with a vaccine that's 85% effective and you have a 93-96% reduction.  That reduces an r₀ of 9 down to 0.63, which would eventually lead to the virus dying out.",0.1885,0.5172,0.2943

- All individuals are required to wear masks indoors beginning Aug. 1 in all campus buildings and other MSU facilities in East Lansing and throughout the state. This requirement will be in place for at least the first weeks of the fall semester.

- All students, faculty and staff are required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 with an FDA-authorized or WHO-approved vaccine by Aug. 31. Limited exemptions for medical or religious reasons will be provided.

You aren't required to be fully vaccinated until the 31st.  Taking this as written, you should be fine until then.  If you're getting the first dose on the 6th, you can easily get the second dose by the 31st, so long as there aren't major logistical difficulties.  And if for some reason you can't get the second dose in time--for instance: as far as I know, most providers will not just give you shot 2 unless you got shot 1 from them also, that way they keep their shots in ""pairs"" and don't end up with too much of one dose and not enough of the other--then President Stanley's email states that ""[s]tudents, faculty or staff who have not completed their vaccine regimen and those exempt from the vaccine for health or religious reasons will be required to take part in MSU’s Early Detection Program or other measures that help keep them safe.""  Presumably you would no longer have to do so upon receiving the second dose.  

If you still have concerns about this, I would recommend calling MSU's ""General Inquiries"" number: 888-353-1294  (source: https://msu.edu/together-we-will/contact.html).  If they don't have the information you need, they can most likely direct you to those who will.

But you have to reach even close to that herd immunity level.

People with the MMR vaccine can still catch measles mumps and rubella from another person, its just much less likely, and the less of those diseases there are circulating the less likely it becomes that someone with the vaccine will contract it. But thats why its important to reach those herd immunity levels, less circulating virus=fewer chances for a virus to infect a vaccinated person.",0.2136,0.564,0.2224

445,"If a fetus is a living person at conception then cut it out of the womb and see how long it lives.

Before about 26 weeks... or the third trimester, a fetus is unlikable outside of the womb. The absolute earliest cases of a fetus surviving is around 24 weeks, and thats only because of the extensive medical technologies we have now. 

Before that point, the fetus is essentially an organ. A tumor, if you will, that would not survive if not for the person's heart, blood, and nutrients feeding it constantly every day. Aborting a fetus affects one person, and one person only, and thats the pregnant person.

Which is entirely incomparable to vaccines. The r0 of covid is about 2. Which means that for every one person infected, that person will infect 2 people on average--which is of course an exponential growth in cases over time, if not being vaccinated only affected the people who *chose* to be unvaccinated, honestly I would say fuck it. 

But it doesn't just affect those people, it affects the immunocompromised and children under the age of 12, as well, and puts us at risk for a mutated virus that could be more aggressive than the original and/or make the vaccine virtually useless.

So while you argue to take away a woman's right to her body in favor of a cluster of cells that live basically as a tumor for the first 6 months (the term during which all abortions take place because after that its a preterm birth and usually because of a medical emergency) You *also* re arguing to make it easier to kill immunocompromised people and children while *also* arguing to give the virus an easier opportunity to mutate until it becomes even deadlier.

The headline is misleading. The reason that most of the people who got the disease were vaccinated is because most people in that area *as a whole* were vaccinated. Vaccinated people tend to get the disease much less severely than unvaccinated people.

The whole “my body, my choice” thing doesn’t hold up here, because if you’re unvaccinated, you can spread COVID-19 easily to other people, many of which are immunocompromised.

617,"Simple answer for me is ""No"" but the reason for this is pretty simple. It's how you sleep. If you know you like the futon because you've slept on it before or always have. If you like a hard surface to sleep on like a futon, then yes. But if you are like most people, you need a mattress. For the amount of time you'll be there, you can get a good one from Walmart in a box. Think a twin xl is $150ish. A foam mattress will give you a much softer sleep which I personally find is more helpful if you're a more active person. But that's just me.  


Decide on how you normally sleep and what you wish you could have. Futon's are generally hard. I also wouldn't want a partner for the night to have to sleep on a futon. If they were nice enough to sleep with you, you should be nice enough to let them sleep on a mattress they are most used to.

You surrender some liberties to protect those which are most important or keep the social order together. In this case, your personal liberty ends where another person's right to be safe starts. If your choice could directly bring harm to others, for example: you refuse the vaccine--then you lose the right to mingle around campus and attend in-person instruction because there are folks who are immuno-compromised or have other immune system issues, or have legitimate religious beliefs which exempt them from vaccination, who depend on herd immunity to be safe from the 'rona.

There are almost 1000 scholarship athletes (not all full ride) at MSU paying sticker price from the Athletics Dept budget, many out of state ($$$).

The average student at MSU receives a great deal of financial aid and scholarships ($10k?), so these full price students on athletic scholarships represent a massive infusion of tuition dollars that all come from athletic revenue. So the AD doesn’t cut a check as a gift, but the athletic dept’s activities and presence directly generates massive amounts of revenue for MSU that schools without successful athletics do not enjoy (e.g ‘they send tens of millions of dollars’ - probably closer to ten than tens, granted).

1277,"&gt;I said in the last 3 days.

And if you were presenting the data honestly you would've said \~1,321 per day in the whole state. These are details that matter, what is someone less informed supposed to think when they see that? 3,900 cases each day for the past 3 days? Just in Ingham county? It's very easy to come to that conclusion with vague wording.

&gt;26x increase = 2600%.

Fair enough. You said 2625%, that's 26.25X, which comes out to 52.5 cases today. I wanted to simplify the math a little bit but I ended up doing exactly what I called you out for, my bad.

Exponential growth could happen, you're right, but given the fact that we have a vax mandate for students, faculty, and staff, our on-campus vax rate should be over 90%. That means spread should be pretty low on campus. Add to that the fact that greater Lansing probably has a reasonably high vax rate as well. Ingham county as a whole doesn't have a great vax rate, but it's also mostly rural farmland, not at all representative of a state capitol/college town.

And it's worth pointing out that yes, campus is pretty empty right now, but the entire student population is less than a fifth of the county population, and again, should have a 90+% vax rate (if MSU actually enforces that mandate).

&gt;As per other threads, numerous classes are already transitioning to online.

Yeah, unfortunately. But we still have some classes in person. When I think of online I think of last year, where every class was put online and nobody was allowed to move in. That almost definitely won't happen again. Also it's safe to say the mask mandate will be gone by the end of the semester given the fact that U of M already got rid of theirs.

1432,"Long-since-graduated Japanese major here (from the first class when it was officially split off into its own major, in 2011). The program was insanely thorough. Classes freshman and sophomore year were 5 days a week, then 4 days a week junior year, then 2 or 3 senior year, though at that point you'll probably be taking more Japanese-related classes rather than just the core language class, plus a capstone. We had vocabulary and kanji tests practically daily. We used the Genki I and II textbooks until 3rd year, plus a coursepack where you'll get most of your worksheets from. Tests were pretty much every other week and there was an oral exam once a semester. I filled endless notebooks just writing the same vocab and kanji over and over. I highly suggest devoting time to making flash cards and listening to the dialog CDs that come with your textbooks.

I did study abroad at the Michigan Japan Center in Hikone the summer before my senior year. My grades weren't awesome even though I was very determined to excel at the language, so getting the chance to immerse myself in a town where literally no one speaks English besides the employees at the school was super helpful. I almost 4.0'd my senior year because of my time in Japan. I really should've studied more (but that's a me problem, not a school problem).

My senior year I had Japanese IV, Japanese Short Stories (also learned fun onomatopoeia in that class), and a capstone where we read The Tale of Genji for the entire semester (in English thankfully!).

Figure out how many points/what your current grade is in the class based on the above information. Then, based on what assignments/exams etc are left in the semester, calculate a reasonable estimate for what score you expect to get on these.

Combine your current points/grade with your estimate, if this is enough to pass the class, you’re good to go, if it’s not, then ask yourself: can I do better on the remaining assignments? 

If not, or if there are not enough remaining points in the class, then contact your professor and ask if there’s extra credit or if they will allow you to turn in late assignments. Don’t be afraid to include reasoning/explanation for why you are struggling in the class.

Effective Fall 2010 the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 (HEOA) requires all institutions receiving federal financial aid to ""publish,"" in time for registration, a list of all required and recommended books and other course materials for all classes offered at the institution. This includes all schools—undergraduate, graduate and professional. The items we must display are:

    Book title, including edition
    Book author
    ISBN number
    Retail price

This is an effort to make more transparent the cost of education, as indicated in the following statement from the HEOA:

PURPOSE AND INTENT—The purpose of this section is to ensure that students have access to affordable course materials by decreasing costs to students and enhancing transparency and disclosure with respect to the selection, purchase, sale, and use of course materials. It is the intent of this section to encourage all of the involved parties, including faculty, students, administrators, institutions of higher education, bookstores, distributors, and publishers, to work together to identify ways to decrease the cost of college textbooks and supplemental materials for students while supporting the academic freedom of faculty members to select high quality course materials for students.

Without vaccines, the best way to mitigate transmission is to have the infected person wear a mask. Given that the disease can infect somebody and make them transmissible without showing symptoms, it's best to have everybody wear masks in places where airflow is restricted. This is not for their own sake, but those around them.   
Vaccines have arrived, and we've done an ok job at vaccinating the public. We really need 70-80% vaccination rate with what was known about the virus previously.. and briefly, we saw infections and death rates plummet.. But, unfortunately, the virus has mutated and evolved. It's now even more contagious, and can be deadlier to more sensitive groups of the population, and is deadlier to those not vaccinated. It's also somewhat resistant to vaccines. For those vaccinated it's still not as deadly, but it allows the vaccinated to be carriers to those without vaccines. So, we must mask again, in places where airflow is restricted.. meaning indoors.. This isn't necessarily for those who are vaccinated, but for those who are not.  


So, does the requirement for vaccines, and masking indoors make more sense now? The vaccine requirement saves more of the lives of those infected.. the masks inhibits the transmission of the virus to those that it is most deadly.",0.0674,0.3612,0.5714

1648,"Kids under 12 are much more equipped to handle covid than adults are for some reason. Globally, there have been over 4 million deaths from covid. Do you know many of those are kids? Less than 400. And kids make up about 13% of cases. So I don't really understand why kids under 12 should get vaccinated before vaccinated adults can continue about their lives without being told that they are killing people because they don't want to be quarantined for another year.

Honestly, I think a world where Covid vaccination rates are high enough for herd immunity is a fantasy world. I wish it wasn't, because believe me when I say I don't want ANYONE dying from Covid. But people have many different reasons for not getting vaccinated, and I know most people like to assume it's because they are either assholes or they are government conspiracists who think the vaccine is a tracking chip, but that's only a very small portion. Most people, like I was at first, are hesitant towards the vaccine because it's so new and no long term studies have taken place. Or because it isn't FDA approved (meaning there is a lot of data the FDA hasn't even looked at). Or because they know they are statistically at very low risk of the virus, either because they are young and healthy or because they live in rural areas where their closest neighbor is miles away. Please don't paint everyone with such a broad ""asshole"" brushstroke.

My solution (which I know will get me plenty of hate) is to tell people to get vaccinated, and if they don't then they have to wear a mask, socially distance, and have other restrictions. If you are vaccinated and still weary, then it is your choice to wear a mask and continue distancing. People who cannot get vaccinated are already at high risk for many other infections, and have to take proper precautions regardless of Covid (please, don't mistake this as me saying ""lol who cares about them""). Covid is always going to stick around, and some people are never going to get vaccinated. Does that mean we stay quarantined forever and never ""return to normal""? And we always blame and yell at people who are hesitant towards new advancements? Maybe your answer is yes, but I don't want to live a life in which I blame the worlds sorrows on a groups of people that I refuse to understand.",0.0183,0.1864,0.7953

I say tell people to get vaccinated, and if they don't (or can't) then have them wear a mask and give them certain restrictions. If you are vaccinated and still want to mask up and stay distanced, then you are well within your rights of doing so.

I read an article recently about a doctor who said the Delta variant was even able to bypass surgical masks. I know everyone is just trying to play it safe and protect people as best as possible, but my issue is that the solutions aren't helpful. During the earlier days of Covid, states that had strict mask mandates did not fair any better than states that didn't. 

I know I'm going to get a lot of hate for this, but please don't assume I'm some anti-vax government conspiracy theorist. I'm fully vaccinated, and I always wore my mask when it was required. It's just frustrating to see everything move backwards and for everyone to hate you if you question it. It started with ""get vaccinated so things can go back to normal"" then it went to ""if you don't get vaccinated then you are killing people"" and now it's ""get vaccinated and wear a mask and don't go near anyone. if you don't then you don't trust science and you are the problem with all of society."" I don't want anyone getting sick, but I say give some choice to people. Tell them to either get the vaccine or you have to wear a mask and you can't do x, y and z.

1692,"Dr. Hayes is a really awesome teacher. The FW101 lab was about like 70% field trips and 30% on campus stuff during the lab days (mine were Friday mornings) with a short recitation earlier in the week. I didn’t use a ton of the equipment or clothing I bought, but if you have waders then that is all you really need!!!! And a good pair of hiking boots. The department had waders but sometimes you’ll find the pairs that have leaks in them. 

You don’t really meet beforehand on field trip days unless you’re getting a ride from him or the TA. During my semester they had 2 small shuttles that could take a handful of students, but if you have a car you can drive yourself too.

I found some real value in being surrounded by fellow students in a campus environment (be it roommates, friends, etc.) I did fall 2020 at home and spring 2021 in EL. Even though both semesters were online and similar difficulty in classes, my GPA was .7 higher in the spring (also worth noting that Fall 2020, the first completely online semester, was by far my worst in terms of performance, GPA was like .3 below my cumulative to that point, and the class difficulty based on average grades was not anything substantially different from what I’ve had.) I’m no psychology major so it’s hard for me to explain but I was just able to stay more focused and be more productive. I think the environment I was physically in at the time ( school vs. home) really played a big role in that, and while lockdown was still ongoing, I was still able to enjoy the time with the people I was living with. Now that game days are gonna be back I think we’re going to be able to get more of that college experience we came here for, classes will be the main difference but there are still ways to enjoy your college experience.

Also important to note that these situations are different for everyone, this is just my experience and whatever anyone else replies is their experience. 

TLDR; from personal experience being able to be physically present on campus is a lot more enjoyable that being stuck at home and I found being in EL to be more productive than being at home.

Edit: noticing a lot of people bringing up the money aspect. Fall 2020 was so bad academically for me that I almost pushed my graduation back a semester (a few extra thousand dollars) just because of nearly failing a class or two.

In this lease it states that if the Tenant does not get an insurance policy The Hub has the right to assign one to a Tenant.

Guys/Gals, y’all need to look up FERPA, not HIPAA

Edit: 

FERPA allows any K-12, or post secondary schools (typically only if they have federal funding)  to maintain educational records of students. Here’s an excerpt on general things in your Educational Record:

&gt;In general, education records are records about current and former students that are maintained by public, private, and parochial schools. Education records contain information about a student, such as: a student’s name, address, and telephone number; a parent’s or guardian’s name and contact information; grades and test scores; health and immunization records; discipline reports; documentation of attendance; schools attended; courses taken; awards conferred and degrees earned; and special education records including individualized education programs (IEPs).

Schools generally need consent to share your information, but there are many exemptions that allows a school to use your information and share it without your consent. That usually involves whether your PII is included in the summary. PII is “personal identifying information.” So like, a school can say “3% of our students have a disability” because there’s no PII. But there are times when they can even use your PII in the disclosure without consent. Not often though.",0.0681,0.5339,0.398

Trying to code a project all at once will do nothing but confuse you when there is inevitable bugs. 

My other advice? Pay attention in class - I know it can be hard but not messing around on your phone or laptop during class in 331 works wonders - the lectures are important and paying attention will make the assignments way easier. Start the assignments early, you WILL NOT be able to do projects in one night (coding challenges might be possible but I’d give yourself a cushion). Use piazza and take advantage of the search features - if you are having an issue odds are someone else did. 

The class (and all 300 level CSE courses) also expect you to be a lot more self sufficient than 200 level. Making a post on piazza or going to help room and saying “my code doesn’t work” or “what’s wrong with my code” will not get you any help or answer. You need to use the debugger and test cases and either solve the problem yourself or ask a detailed question, more like “hey I am failing on the test case when there is 0 elements in the list and I’ve stepped through the debugger and don’t know exactly what is going on, can you help me with it?”

.01 The Secretary of the Board of Trustees is empowered to establish regulations restricting or prohibiting access to and/or use of University buildings and property in order to provide for the convenient and efficient conduct of the University's affairs, and the management and protection of such buildings and property; such regulations must be posted in the affected areas.

Michigan State University has established policies, ordinances, and regulations to reduce the risk of fire hazards in campus buildings. Given the current risk of fire associated with hoverboards, electric mobility devices, and other similar equipment and the lack of recognized safety standards for hoverboards, electric mobility devices, and other similar equipment, the Secretary of the Board of Trustees hereby prohibits the use, charging, storage, and possession of hoverboards, electric mobility devices, and other similar equipment in all University buildings.

For the purpose of this ordinance, “electric mobility device” means any device in, upon, or by which, any person or property is or may be transported that has an electrical propulsion system (including, without limitation, electric bicycles, electric skateboards, and other electric mobility devices designed as such pursuant to section 33.02).

That is why you need an annual flu shot, the flu mutates into new variants every year and we need to be re-protected against them.

2631,"That’s not accurate. There’s been no evidence to suggest the vaccine wanes in efficacy, especially after such a short time. The only reason a booster has been recommended is because variants have been emerging that may require extra protection to help prevent transmission and give you extra protection against getting ill from the virus. But, the vaccines still work very well against hospitalization and death at this point. Though that might change with future variants because Delta has proven to be a challenge.",0.3193,0.5295,0.1512
2632,"Efficacy has only waned for infection. The vaccines still work very well against hospitalization and death, which is what the vaccines were designed to do. The only reason we lifted mask mandates for vaccinated people originally was because they found the vaccines had the added benefit of virtually preventing infection from the original strain and the Alpha variant. That is no longer the case for Delta variant and how transmissible it is. However, the  vaccines still work very well to protect you from death and hospitalization.

You’re objectively wrong that this is all hysterical. It is proven, especially with current COVID surges, that the unvaccinated are driving COVID spread, COVID deaths, and COVID hospitalizations. We only have 50% of this country fully vaccinated, with an entire section of our population (children under 12) ineligible for the vaccine at this point. We don’t have enough vaccinations to ensure we can move on from the virus. That’s why the vaccination program is so important. 

The vaccine was only meant to stop serious illness, which means vaccinated people can still spread Delta variant hence the need for masks again.

2774,"Not just MSU but general college: 

everyone is going to be flailing the first few weeks/months, even upperclass students thanks to Covid-19 preventing in-personal classes and a regular schedule last year. In some sense, the first semester is a critical time to mesh and find some people and groups you enjoy. I made friends I would’ve never had on paper but even if people are different, you’re all together in the “omg what is life and what is college” crisis. 

no-one is going to think about you as much as you do. People don’t care/forget easily if you trip and spill your books or accidentally sit in the wrong class. MSU especially is huge so people are busy and you’re always worried more about your own life than anyone else’s. 

however, there are plenty of idiots and pricks in college. You think it’s just a teenager highschool thing but is is disappointingly not so. so while you’ll have great opportunities to make friends your first year, that doesn’t mean you have to stay friends with people who aren’t good friends. people come and go and you’re always having to renegotiate your social expectations and who you hang out with and stuff. It’s okay to quietly drop out of a circle of friends if they’re always going to tailgate parties and talk about sports. learn to hold things well but loosely. I learned how to be a drifter—the people who are friends with different groups and drift between them but aren’t necessarily locked in and dependent on any one group. This isn’t everyone’s style but it’s a good way to think about things as you find your way. 

real connections usually require initiative. someone you really feel like you gel with in class? study with them, go shopping together, etc. Don’t spend all semester thinking about it and then regret it because you never see that person again. I made some great friends in totally unexpected places just by trying to put myself out there. I’m not an outgoing or extroverted person so it sucked, but I’m grateful for it nonetheless. 

I know it’s easier said than done, but just be yourself and see what happens. I was an extreme misanthropic introvert when I went into undergrad and I came out much better for wear.",0.3177,0.4456,0.2367

**If you live in their ""Luxury"" apartments.

Seriously, I lived in one of their luxury units and I got maintenence to fix issues within hours, never had to push them to make fixes, people were responsive and only a phone call away except for one property manager who wouldn't do anything about off leash dogs because she liked to let HER dog off leash. She was forced to do something about it when an off leash dog charged and attacked my dog and I, so I kicked it so hard I'm fairly sure I broke it's rib. Other than that, it was great, but I couldn't really justify the rent for just myself, and was planning to move in with my SO so we looked elsewhere.


Then I moved to a much larger townhouse style apartment which is less luxury, more working class, families, not rich porche driving sltudent living. I moved in with a broken water heater and it took 3 WEEKS and 6 calls, and even then, they didn't call a plumber until I showed up in their office and refused to leave until I watched them make the phone call. The AC to the second floor was barely moving and when the living room was set to 69 ^^^(nice) my bedroom and home office was 77-80. They sent the maintenence guy (the only one, but he's so nice and friendly and overworked) and he said ""if this doesn't fix it, tell the office to send someone to clean the vents."" It didn't fix it, I told the office, they said they need to send the guy to check if the vents need cleaning. The guy who told me to tell them. 2 weeks, 4 calls, and another trip to the office where I get mean and refuse to leave later, they call someone to clean the vents FINALLY. they also gave us the wrong information for roommate additions, and when I got locked out, they had no on call manager and no emergency maintenence like they advertise, so I was locked out in my backyard for 3 hours until dark when I finally got someone from another community across town to let me in. They tried to blame me for locking myself out rather than them for having no remedy but break the window or call another ""luxury"" DTN property.

Do similar things with your other interests. 

It sounds so simple, but when I was a freshman it literally did not occur to me to do that. For example, I really liked to play Super Smash Brothers Melee but my roommate and his friends mostly wanted to play Halo, so I just went along with that even though I never really enjoyed Halo. I never considered that there might be other students at MSU who loved melee and would play with me, until my senior year I met a group of people who were super into melee and had taken the game to level I didn't even know existed and played in tournaments and stuff. I didn't even know there were tournaments at that time.

Going east along it, past farm lane, you get a couple hills which may be a little difficult for you unless before the hill, you switch to a lower gear. Low gears makes climbing a hill that much easier, but it also helps to get the speed before hand.  


Assuming everyone follows the sidewalk rules (no one does) then the cyclists and walkers should be separated. I personally use the road because I have an electric bike and I find it safer for everyone involved (payment plans make it affordable). But if you're going at a slow pace, you'll still be going faster than everyone else. It should be pretty calming dependent on the weather (as a lanky person, weather really makes the difference).  


If you're worried about having an accident, it's always advised to wear a helmet and go slow. There's no reason to go fast unless you are confident in yourself. Go to one of the many bike shops and spend the money to get your brakes working like new because nothing's worse than a bike that doesn't stop when needed.

The main thing is practice. I’d go to the MSU bike store and see if they have any advice on actual riding mechanics. Then practice in a safe area until you feel comfortable.

3258,"Doing a Zoom recording of an in-person class is not the easiest.  You would need to somehow capture chalkboards/whiteboards, questions from the class, and also the instructor's audio to even be close to useful.   if the class was 100% online, recording the Zoom session is possible because all that stuff is there.

The auto-transcripts from Zoom are 'meh' if you have perfect audio from everybody, and really bad if you don't.  On top of that, transcripts really break down when you start to add in more lexicon that is not in normal conversational English.  For example, the Zoom transcriptions kept replacing ""Ethernet"" with ""Ember"" in each of my classes.  Having accurate transcriptions is absolutely important for students who depend on them to learn (including those who have disabilities and those who simply learn better by reading).    Correcting transcripts that come out of Zoom and other products is a real PITA (also, Zoom's transcript export is not compatible with any captioners, so you end up having to do most of the work either way).

Editing a lecture to make it useful is important.  When I did my classes online, I had a webcam pointing to a whiteboard, an input from an iPad, my video and the PPT that I used to guide the class.  For me to mix those in, you do have to edit the video.  Sure, if all I had was a talking head or just reading off PPT slides (which you all could do on your own), editing would be less necessary.  

I've been teaching hybrid, online and offline classes for about 12 years now.  This stuff isn't new -- and it takes a /ton/ of work.  Now, MSU could certainly provide more resources to faculty to help us do these things -- but that's not an investment they really have made.  Some schools like ASU provide 1-2 assistants for every class to make sure every class gets captured, transcribed, edited and published properly.  MSU provided some student helpers to caption lectures for 2 semesters (and we still had to pay for them out of our dept budget).",0.1898,0.5161,0.2941

We have Bible studies across campus once a week, usually about 10 people to a study, and meet once a week on Thursday nights as a large group. The large group meetings typically alternate between our college pastor giving a talk and a short worship night followed by everyone spending time together. We plan activities and do stuff together pretty often, but not on a regular schedule. We also attend church together on Sundays, we drive vans to the dorms to pick everyone up and take them to South Church. 

My favorite part of our ministry is the focus on discipleship - we put a lot of emphasis on walking closely alongside other believers and growing closer to God together. Most of the younger students meet up weekly-ish with an older student, and most of the older students are meeting up with an adult from the church.

No, actually we had lots of options. People could have locked-down for a few months while a vaccine was prepared. This would have drastically slowed the spread. Once that vaccine was prepared, they could have all gotten it and continued to wear masks for a few more months, which would have almost completely stopped the spread of the virus. Had we simply done what was recommended, we likely would be done with COVID.

Instead, I had to sit and watch people complain all last summer about how bored they were, and watch [All Gas No Brakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UK2FBEpmlUo) interview people at a biker rally with 500,000 people closely congregating together.

The True answer is to check

That website does not list the literal quarter point but like it gives the midpoint (10/20) so I guess we can say that 9/1 to 10/20 is 49 or 50 days excluding or counting end date and thus 25 days in would be the approx quarter point assuming uniformity in break periods so we can calculate something raw.


That puts the expected value of the quarter point as the weekend of 25-26th thus I’d guess most likely that Friday the 24th or Monday the 27th is the quarter point.

BUT they don't always get the bike lanes on the major street well.  If you are coming from off-campus, Lansing and East Lansing leave a lot to be desired for all but the major trunk lines.  Some of the smaller townships (like Delhi or Delta) are even poor at those.

That being said -- in the late fall/winter I ride a fat bike on the streets and get around just fine.  Most of the time I can take the river trail to campus without issues (assuming it's not flooded), and once I'm on campus it's easy.  I wouldn't want to ride a road bike on campus in the winter, but a MTB or fat bike is fine.

As far as renting, MSU Bikes is fine.  Treat the bike like your own (and not a rental) and you will be fine.  They hook you up with locks and in theory should show you the best way to lock stuff up on campus.  If you are on campus and keep it in the bike rooms during the winter when you aren't using it -- you will keep it looking good enough to get your deposit back.  Their bikes aren't anything to shake a stick at (many of them are recycled or reclaimed), but they should be good to get around.  I've had one on campus for many years and it use to get around when my nicer bike is parked in the office.  

The hardest thing about riding in the winter is dealing with the weather.  You will get cold/wet/sweaty riding around campus.  As long as that doesn't bother you too much, you should be fine.

I was just trying to reassure this person that if they took a little longer than 20 minutes that it was okay. Realistically no one is going to get all their stuff out and placed in their room in 20 minutes. Consider how long it can take to sometimes get a cart, then the line for the elevator (only one cart fits in at a time), then the unload time from the cart to the room. If you need to do more than one load, then it takes even longer. 

I've been through my fair share of move ins. People who take under 20 minutes live on the first floor and didn't bring much. The average person, with a team of family members, will still take longer than 20 minutes. Factor in an actual COVID precaution of limiting the amount of people you have to help?

Not trying to discourage. It's just something that happens every year. Everyone has a bike and if you look like you belong, for all anyone knows you're just struggling to put your lock on the bike and not cutting it off. If I was you, I'd go to The Lansing Bike Co-Op and pick up one of their bikes for $100. Cause looking at the rental agreement, you'll most likely never get the $200 deposit back. Not in full anyway. Anything damaged has to be replaced and that comes out of the deposit, and the bike racks are always over crowded so almost all the time something will be damaged.

CSE 231 - Failed. The pacing of this class was a mess, the content itself was doable if you were okay with investing a LOT of time into it. There was available help during in person class time, but you were shit outta luck if you needed help outside of it. Exams were challenging. Homework was tedious. Doable class but nothing redeeming about it.

CMSE 201 - Failed. Somehow, this class actually covered more content than CSE 231 despite 231 being the main, common (and difficult) introductory programming course. The pacing of this class ramps up so hard in its later stages and it builds upon EVERY single thing you learned prior, so if you were confused on even one topic you could find yourself unable to complete an entire assignment. Exams were challenging. Homework was very tedious. Help however was readily available. Unlike the other 2 classes, you have a big project to complete in this one by the end of the semester - again, very challenging and time consuming. This course struck me the most as “this is not an introductory programming course” than all the others.

CSE 102 - Got an easy 4.0. The pacing was actually amazing (for reference, this class only covered HALF of the content in its entirety of both CSE 231 and/or CMSE 201, which I consider a positive). There was a lot of help available whenever you needed it. Exams were slightly challenging. Homework took time but never felt too long.

Basically all around campus we have “Sparty’s” stores, which just sell like the kind of stuff you’d find at a conscience store. A good chunk of the items in there are marked A, B, and C items. A items tend to be drinks, B items are an “entree” - think Kraft Mac and cheese cup or cereal cups, C items are like a side/snack, such as crackers. Each combo lets you get one A, B, and C item for free. 

You get 12 combos a week with your dining plan this year. It has varied in the past which I why you will hear different things, when I was in the dorms we got 6 a week with a one a day limit. 

Combos can also be used for hot food at some Spartys locations (brody only one I can think of), at select restaurants on campus (including most of not all in the international center, this is also new this year), and if I am not mistaken combos can also be used on concessions at the football games if you go.

Just realize the people who are trying to hit up every frat are a minority. I would estimate 90% of freshman are feeling the same way you are. 

If you want some perspective from a senior, college is a whole other ball game compared to high school. In high school, you're all crammed into a classroom like sardines and forced to interact. College is more ""you get back what you put in."" If you go all out into one scene, say greek life for instance, expect to have your social circle revolve around that scene. If you put in a little effort into a plethora of groups, expect that to be reflected.

My advice would be to relax (easier said than done I know) and acknowledge that this feeling will pass. Once classes start and clubs begin meeting, there will be plenty of time to get one on one with people. It's just really hard right now because there aren't that many opportunities for the one on one interactions that's necessary to build friendships.

So idk about other people but I like getting outside quite a lot because I have no life &gt;.&gt; but whenever I'm out, I try to wear a light weight convertible pair of pants. Convertible means that it can go from pants, to shorts, with ease. I am aware I look like a dumbass when I'm changing into pants or shorts but it fits my needs. But because of this, I don't get eaten alive. I also wear a cotton long sleeve which I can roll the sleeves up to turn into a short sleeve. A combination of this and a light sweater when it gets colder, and mosquito's aren't much a problem.

Assuming you can find any mosquito spray (ordering on amazon will be faster than buying in person, everyone's out), I like the liquid spray bottles compared to the canister spray bottles. The liquid ones I feel repel mosquito's a little more.

I normally like to be prepared personally, so that's why I dress like this. I'm sure you can get away with less but it works. The Baker Woodlot is pretty flat but there are some areas in it that are pitted last I knew so there could be water collected there for mosquito's to breed. But off trail there are plenty of places for poison ivy or poison oak to grow, so long pants are good for that. Especially if you're hiking in tall grass, assuming there is any, it helps with stopping ticks from eating at you.

5110,"I just wanted to hop in here and mention something as a resident. If you like biking then might I suggest looking up the length of the River Trail. It branches throughout most of the city of Lansing and even travels to Haslett and Holt. It's a bike friendly path with safety crossings on the roads to make it safer for you to cross the street. I'm pretty sure that the bike path that follows the river in MSU is a part of that. If there's ever flooding, chances are there are ways around it with a small hike which is totally doable with a bike.  


For thrift shops, the best ones I think are the VOA thrift shops. There's one just past the Lansing mall which opened up last year I believe, which has a giant section of women's clothing (jelly) and plenty of other random items and nicknacks. A little bit before that, near the Meijers, is a Goodwill which is also really nice. There is also another thrift store on Waverly and Saginaw in the block of stores. Forget what it's called though. These two stores are both in West Lansing.   


In Reo Town there is a thrift store that is called St.Vincent's I believe. It has beautiful furniture pieces and a lot of clothing but their prices tend to be a little more expensive. Across the street from it there is a building which has loads of unique items that you just gotta see.   


Going south from that both on Cedar, there's a VOA which is directly off one of the River Trail branches, this store is another favorite as it has a load of different options and because it's right on river trail, it makes it bike friendly. South of that about a mile is a Goodwill which also has a lot of stuff but I don't visit it often.  


In Old Town, there aren't many thrift stores but it is a big art inspired place. There are plenty of antique stores and interesting places to shop from. Their art fairs are top notch.",0.8845,0.1109,0.0046

We all expanded our circles and through the (close to 20 years) since graduating we've talked about how we stayed friends and how some of those new friends we made are now in our mutual circles. Anyhow, all 3 of us joined things. I did Alpha Phi Omega the non-greek co-ed Service Frat that was loosely formed by former Boy Scouts as I am an Eagle Scout. Another friend joined one of the A Cappella groups because of the American Pie movie (hey, it came out the year we graduated HS). Another did an investment/business like club, I don't remember exactly but it wasn't exactly what we thought she was interested in but she had a good time and stuck with it all 4+ years. 

All I'm saying is there are hundreds of clubs at MSU, if you have even the fleetest of interests in something there is probably a club for it. Here, I even found the website for them for you [https://msu.campuslabs.com/engage](https://msu.campuslabs.com/engage).

The way it sounds, you'll be out in all kinds of weather and I'd rather have those than what I have now. A good pair of Fjallraven pants can survive any type of weather.  


Never heard of Permethrin till now, do you soak your clothes in the mixture to coat it fully? Which model shoe did you get?   


For a winter shoe I love the Snowburban UltraDry from Vasque. Comes insulated which means that all those winter camping trips I took, my feet stayed warm for the most part. The only time that they were ever really cold was the following morning where my sweat caused them to freeze. Although if you're going to be out and abouts a lot like it seems based off your knowledge, I'd recommend you get a boot that comes with a liner.  


Regarding the fan, I wouldn't use it unless you already have problems with heat. If you're dressed right, your body should be able to regulate it's self. A good sunhat and cooling cloth is the best way to go about cooling yourself. If it's extra hot, I would suggest a [pack](https://www.moosejaw.com/product/osprey-syncro-20-hydration-pack_10412987) like this instead of whatever you're caring. If you do get that, get the red color as in the outdoor world red and orange are colors that make you stand out. Plus it has a 2.5 water bladder as well I believe, or room for one. Get a cooling rag that's about the same size as a dish towel. You can normally throw it in any form of liquid, a river or stream would work, and it'll keep you cool. Once dry do it again and you're good again. I'd also find yourself a good shade hat. The right shade hat will block a lot of the heat coming down onto you and with it being breathable, you're more able to stay regulated. Packable ones are helpful tool because you can throw it in the bottom of your pack and you're good.   


If you wanna talk gear, we can do that anytime. I just know that showing up with the latest gadgets isn't always the smart move. You will find that weight means everything if you're going to be packing supplies.

5975,"I used to get like this but not much anymore. I've thought about it too much. Best suggestion I'd have for you is to take this time to learn this yourself.

But in the event of a fire in most multi story buildings, most elevators will not be running (idk if it's the same for a drill) so the first move would be to go to the stairways. There should be signs in the area on the walls that point to the nearest stairway, if you haven't seen or used them already. But stay calm cause I know sirens and alarms can be scary and a shock to the system. Get your shoes on if they aren't already, phone, wallet, keys, water, and maybe a coat.

In the event of a fire, you'd go straight to the sink with a T-Shirt and wet it to cover your mouth with and then towards the stairs in a calm manner after you've gotten your belongings and check if the handle is hot. When learning to blacksmith I was told to use the back of your hand to gauge if metal's hot, so I'd do the same with each closed door before you open it. If it's not a drill, staying low to the ground and covering your face with a wet cloth, breathing through your nose only, will help prevent smoke inhalation. The emergency stairs should have a direct exit to the outside so if there isn't any smoke in the stairway, you're good. If there is smoke, don't open it. Always good to find out where the smoke's coming from.

Fire extinguisher needs to have the hose nose pointed at the very bottom of the flame. You're not fighting the flame, you're fighting the thing that's on fire.

In the event that you can't use the stairs, idk what to say for that. If you want a solution you could join the MSU Outdoor Club and join them on their trips to Grand Ledge where you can learn to repel. If you had that skill you could go out the window but I'd only suggest that after you've gone into training for it.

Also cause I'm high and the ramble is strong right now. It sounds like you were how I was, and when I was like that I got into the outdoors because having those skills means that no matter what happens, I know how to stay safe during it. Knowledge weighs nothing so it's worth learning the skills now with the clubs that can help teach you them.

No, not at all. If you are disabled and are physically unable to get downstairs, please take the elevator. The elevator will be functioning, even if there is no electricity in the building. By Michigan law, all elevators are required to be serviced every 12 months to ensure power availability in a outage. However, if you make it to the elevator after a firefighter has already taken control of the elevator, it will not go to your specified floor. It will be in Fire Mode and all inputs/calls will be disabled from exterior calls (technically Indpt Service overrides Fire Mode but let's no go there). 


 If you are not disabled, please do NOT take the elevator. The reason you do not want to take an elevator during a fire is to ensure that firefighters are able to use the elevator without issue.

Auditions: I went with my mom because I couldn't drive and needed transportation. But it's best to give your kid space before and during the audition - don't hover. Let them get in the zone and do their thing.

Number of auditions: I think I auditioned at 5 or 6 schools, but I probably should have gone for more. Not sure what a good number for choral is; your kid should ask their private teacher. It's about balancing your chances of getting in (which depends on your skill level and the reputation of and competition for the school) vs the amount of repertoire you have to prepare.

Professors: On the instrumental side, we got a lesson with our professor and our TA (doctoral student) once a week, plus a group lesson with the whole studio once a week.

A note on the music buildings: they're kind of ancient and a little gross. Bathrooms had flies constantly, practice rooms (all in the basement) had house centipedes, and there were SO MANY STAIRS because one of the buildings is 5 stories including the basement.

If doing a thesis is important to you, I'd recommend that you start looking sooner rather than later. I'm not sure what exactly is standard (that would be a good question to ask Dr. Kulkarni), but I can say that 1) the sooner you start, the more time you have to explore different options and figure out what you're actually interested in, and 2) taking on a new student is a big time investment for a professor to make, and they'll see it as more likely to pay off if you can work with them for longer.

Try looking through the list of faculty on the department website and choose a few that sound like they're doing interesting stuff. Tell them you're trying to figure out what you're interested in working on and ask if you can try coming to a few of their lab meetings. That way you'll get a chance to see A) whether you're interested in their research, and B) whether their lab seems like an environment you want to be in.",0.4194,0.5415,0.0391

Even after the pandemic, trauma exists and it will take time for some people to unpack that and feel safe again. 

Think of it like this: My great grandmother worried about starvation during WWI (as a child) and again during WII (as an adult.) For the rest of her life, she was a hoarder and literally couldn’t bring herself to throwing food away because of a fear of those traumas that occurred.

It’s likely going to be some time before some people can be comfortable being open in public again and that’s okay.

6844,"Good post OP.  I am an alumni and I did some recruiting at an MSU job fair pre-COVID.  Here is one other pointer to add, this time from the POV of the recruiter.  

Have an answer to the question, “why do you want to work at Company X?”  

- The recruiter is trying to find out 2 things with that question, did the student prepare and do they want to work here?
- Preparation entails 3-5 minutes reading about the company on Wikipedia and Yahoo Finance.  If it’s not a public company google recent news articles.  You should know what industry the company is in, if it’s large or small, what their core business is.  Bonus points if you make a casual reference to positive stock trends or a big announcement in the news.  
- As for why, you can’t go wrong with something like “Company X is a global leader in telecom and they are changing the world with 5G, and I want to be a part of something big. I really want to work at Company X.”  Modify as appropriate of course.  The point is to have an answer that conveys that you really want to work at that company.  

When debating between a pool of equality qualified student candidates (all have decent grades, little to no professional experience) to hire 1 or 2, recruiters will chose the ones that express the most enthusiasm to work at the company.  They are more likely be better team players and better colleagues.  This is because when it comes time to do real work, the employees who want to work at that company will maintain a higher sense of happiness/satisfaction when under some pressure.  

When you’re a student all you have are grades, maybe a little work experience, volunteerism, projects, and your personality / attitude.  Play each of those up as much as possible.  In the end, recruiters working these fairs are hiring colleagues, directly or indirectly.  Being someone they would be happy to work with goes very far.",0.5121,0.443,0.0449

1. Whether you use Apple Maps, google maps, transit, or some other app to plan your trip, ALWAYS plan on your “arrival time” to be 10-15 minutes before you actually need to be somewhere. That way, if a bus is early and you miss it, you won’t be entirely screwed. 
2. Routes 30-39 are FREE. I believe all other bus routes have a reduced student fare with a valid student ID. 
3. The bus driver will not stop unless you press the stop button/pull on the string thingy BEFORE your stop.
4. I have never been here for a game day, so idk what that will be like. However, I’m guessing the routes for south neighorhood (30,33,35, and 38 I believe?) will be crowded as heck. You might have to stand, which you can adjust to. 
5. YOU MUST WEAR A MASK AT ALL TIMES WHILE ENTERING/ON THE BUS SYSTEM. Please just keep your mask on, it makes everyone’s lives easier.

Specificity is a measure of how many of the ""Falses"" are actually False. 

Imagine there was a test so terrible, it always said positive unless it was testing something so obviously wrong that it had to mark it as False. It would get a 100% specificity rating, because every time it called a test run False, it was.

I sit on the concrete on either side and just take it slow when you stand up in the water and walk. There's a clear line where the concrete stops on either side.

Just be careful at night. You're obviously in the middle of the river but people do stupid stuff for no reason. Last night there was a fight upriver by the closest bridge. That was fun.

It's up to you, but I use a bottle of water to rinse off my feet and hand sanitizer after, just incase. And then I get socks and shoes on to leave. I have not bothered to learn what is up river and how nasty the water is.

7675,"Additional tips from a former RA (albeit from a different university)!

* Beer Pong | I don't care how fun beer pong is, don't play it in the dorms. We don't care if it's water pong or not, once we see it, we have to write it up. 
* Alcohol Keepsakes | I know you might think it's ""cool"" to keep all your old liquor bottles or your old cans. First, its not cool its super lame. Second, even if the bottles are empty we have to write you up, because really, who would keep empty bottles if they  didn't drink them?
* Noise Level | Realistically, if your door is closed the only time we will knock is if your noise level is way too loud. Generally, those are the people who are also drinking. Sure, occasionally you find a group of guys just having a ball of a time doing Britney Spears karaoke (True story), but its almost always a guarantee that there is drinking in the room. So, keep your noise level reasonable and we won't have to knock. Now, what is reasonable varies RA to RA, but I found the most common ""reasonable level"" was ""Can I hear that room  from more than 3 doors down?""
* When We Do Knock | Those doors are thin, we *can* hear you say ""Oh shit, its the RA, hide the beer!"" (another True story). Additionally, if you only crack the door a sliver, its an immediate indicator that y'all are hiding alcohol in there. Do as the above commenter recommended and invest in some less obvious glasses for your dorm party and *preemptively* hide the alcohol. Keep it in the mini fridge or away from the visible area when you open your door a normal amount. Obviously, when there's drinking you're not going to be actively thinking about making sure the beer cans are in the designated trash bag, but it will benefit you to do it. Just be cool when you open the door, don't be sketchy, and we'll just let you know to keep the noise down. Well. Unless you get a hardass RA, but they'll just include ""suspected drinking"" on the report if you took all the precautions I listed.",0.1478,0.4789,0.3732

- invest in a Yeti mug |
Doesn’t look like a solo cup and isn’t as obvious as a beer can. If the RA can’t see a label, they can’t write it up (and they don’t want to). Under no circumstances can they make you open it so they can smell or taste it. Nor can they search your room, only police can do that. 

- get some Nalgene bottles | 
Same idea. Fill the Nalgene bottle with your Smirnoff and Svedka. Discard the labeled bottle. Can literally keep it out in the open and it’s perfectly safe. Just don’t accidentally grab it instead of your real water bottle and head to IM west. 

- Running IS an option | 
When you’re really up shits creek and you trust your friends, you can legit run. Granted, this only works if you don’t live in that dorm. You can run from RA’s and I was trained not to chase you. Police will chase though and I’ve seen more than a couple get hunted by the dog. 

- Smoke outside |
it’s just not worth it to smoke inside. It’s the one thing we HAD to call campus PD for if we smelled it strongly. It sucked. I always felt bad. And those dogs are insanely good. Cool to watch them work. Don’t try to outsmart their nose. The pups win every time. 

- Amnesty rule ([more details here](https://www.deanofstudents.msu.edu/sites/default/files/content/MedicalAmnestyQA.pdf)) | 
Just something to be aware of. This was new back in 2011 but might not be well known. If you’re in a situation where you’re worried about your friend, you and that friend are 100% protected from receiving an MIP if you call the RA and medical services are requested. This includes alcohol intox and drug intox. Just something cool to know about. When I found passed out kids, I’d always document their friend called even if they didn’t.

The Avenue if you can handle that type of vibe all the time while studying. The Grid is another option as it's built similarly.

7765,"Hi! Just transferred from community college. I suggest going for the full two years and getting your associates. There's some really good scholarships you can get just from doing that. Contact an admissions advisor at MSU ASAP and tell them your major and they can help you choose credits that will transfer into your major and the pre-recs that transfer too! (Don't just use your community college counselor, they don't know as much. Trust me I tried lol.)

I went and got my associates but I didn't choose a major until I got to MSU so a lot of the credits I took didn't go towards a major or a minor. If you know what you want to do definitely contact an admissions advisor! 

If you do want to go after your first year,  start your application now. I believe the deadline is in February or March, if it's not rolling admissions, but the earlier you apply the better your chances in either circumstance.

As for the time to recharge, that is the really tough part. Look for buildings like the top level of the library, which is nice and quiet, or other buildings on campus with some nice places to sit (outside in the gardens or fields also works for as long as it’s warm). 

If you set aside 30 minutes in this space and consider it personal time where you just chill and try not to worry about school, this could be an option for recharging. If you really need a nap or just need to be in your room I think it would be reasonable to ask your roomate to leave for an hour or two, but if he says no then what can you really do. If you want to be indirect you could say you are having a date over to the room or a friend and you would like a few hours alone with them. Best of luck with this.",0.2219,0.5525,0.2256

Go to the MSU Planetarium, the Broad Art Museum, visit the Horticulture Gardens and the Children’s 4H Garden, get ice cream at the MSU Dairy Store. See a concert or show at the Wharton Center or the Snyder Phillips RCAH Theater. Walk/skate/bike up and down the Red Cedar River. Go to a MSU football/basketball game. Many other sports are open to students as well. Go pet and fawn over the horses at the Horse Teaching and Research Facility. Same with the cows at the Dairy Cattle Teaching and Research facility. Go ice skating at the Munn Ice Arena. If you’re 21 and over go to the bars on the weekends. If you have a car go to the MSU Sailing Center at Lake Lansing where you can kayak, canoe, sail, paddle board. Or enjoy the Michigan Fall season by driving to Uncle Johns Cider Mill for donuts, pumpkins, apple cider, and apple picking. Try bubble tea from each of the 6 bubble tea stores in East Lansing. Go to a 24 Hour Meijer in the middle of the night. And of course try dining hall on campus food or go off campus and eat your heart out.

GPA is important! Try to get at least 3.3 cumulative, the higher the better. After you apply, there will be a wide window before actually get in to msu, get more credits done in community college as possible( it saves money and it’s easier).

To the right, there are quite a few places where people set up hammocks but the area around it is littered with sticks, branches, and large limbs from storms past.

First is picking up the trash and placing them in bags near a trash can. After the clean up I'll try to find who to notify to pick up the wood and trash. Any wood we find no matter how big or small, we will place on the nice and pretty grass. This wood also includes any logs or sticks caught in the shallows. Picking up any trash that might be in the water as well.

The left side will have the same process repeated but we'll be careful of glass as people are stupid and throw beer bottles. There is a crane that fishes on the left and I'd like to clean up that area a little bit more. The entire path way on the left honestly.

I foresee maybe 3 people showing up so if anyone does end up being interested, this might be a long term project. But if a lot of people show up, I am too shy to lead anything and I hate public speaking. It's why I am mentioning it all here.

If anyone's going to go into the water, it's suggested that they bring a bucket with them for any glass (dollar tree has them) and some sort of water shoe or rubber boots to protect against glass. At the very bottom of the picture where the water is smooth, it's really shallow. But in the rapids and past them, there are loads of rocks of different sizes which isn't safe to walk on in bare feet. Plenty of water to drink is also advised.

No, but it makes them not my problem. If you're not going to protect yourself, then why should I protect you?

&gt;Additionally, people have been asking as to why we have four times as many exemptions as UoM, who have only approved 650-700 while MSU has approved 2,500 (with another 2000 pending and under review)

Contact tracing isn't letting people know that they've been exposed to positive cases in a timely fashion due to there being like four people **total** on staff handling it- and as a result more people are getting sick. Not to mention, our means for verifying vaccinations when the mandate came into effect were essentially a glorified honor system.  


Just because you're immunized doesn't mean you can't catch or carry the virus- when you're spending hours in classrooms breathing collective air that may or may not be building with viral matter from a yet to be revealed positive case, there is still a good chance that someone will wind up carrying it or getting sick. The promises and agreements the college admin made to the faculty unions are not being upheld, and as a result the wellbeing of faculty, staff, students, and our surrounding communities is at risk.

However, it has nothing to do with the pandemic - it’s been increasing for years. This would be fixed with free healthcare for all - I know many college students who can’t afford to get prescriptions for medicine that they know they need, and who can’t afford therapy. Therapy is still available online - MSU has a fair amount of resources for that iirc.

As of this moment, around 130 people die of suicide each day. (In the US)

Over 1000 people die from covid each day. (In the US)

Copy/pasting from another thread,”. How is it different from the seasonal flu:

While not entirely understood, there’s a very strong correlation between Covid-19 and organ damage. This is very apparent in extreme cases, but has also been observed in “healthy,” asymptomatic patients.

Long-Covid is a thing, I.e. Covid where the infection itself goes away but the symptoms (fatigue, brain fog, shortness of breath/asthma development, etc) continue on for months.

Old people and the immunocompromised still exist, overweight or not, they will always be there, and just like everyone else, overweight people included, they deserve the same care and treatment as everyone else who goes into a clinic asking for or needing help. I see what you are saying but it was irrelevant to the conversation at hand. But now it is relevant so let's talk about it.

The presence and oversaturation of fast food conglomerates and (especially) Western society's proclivity for instant gratification is an issue. But it's an issue that's been in the making since long before the concept of ""Western society"" was even considered a thing worth labeling. It's a culmination of centuries upon centuries of innovation and destruction, progress and missteps, discovery and obfuscation. And it's a problem. 

I don't doubt that the prevalence of fast food and unhealthy lifestyles hasn't helped the US or any other country during the COVID crisis. I also don't doubt that the prevalence of poverty and lack of access to resources, which often leads to unhealthy lifestyles as there is nothing else they can reliably consume and is out of their control, has also not helped. 

That's not to even mention the conflicting bullshit the media tells people on ""how a pretty person looks"" or ""have this fad diet that'll fix all your problems"", etc, that leads to yo-yo dieting and eating disorders, which are incredibly damaging to ones mental, emotional and physical well-being. (Not fun fact: not eating enough and/or having a severe enough or long-term ED, restrictive types especially, can just as easily, if not more so, lead one to be more susceptible to illness and disease, COVID included.)

With all that said, your take ain't it, chief. By your logic, we should let the overweight just die because they were brought up and roped into the same toxic, over-processed, get-it-while-it's-hot mentality that plagues this country and nearly every other ""first-world"" or industrialized nation on Earth. The middle of a pandemic isn't the time to say, ""eh fuck you, I deem you and everyone you know and who loves you unworthy of being treated with respect."" And your only reasoning for doing so is because the inflicted is fat. Getting mad /at/ the inflicted is purely motivated by bias and unfounded hatred towards those you think of as 'lesser'.

If you want to get mad, then get mad at the fast food industry. Get mad at the faceless, cold and uncaring corporations who shill these ideas to us 24/7, the same corporations who're underpaying their manual laborers, feeding into that cycle of poverty mentioned earlier while shoveling more money into the never-ending pockets of the higher-ups, then get mad. Get fucking pissed. Then realize they don't give a shit. Consumer or not, they don't care. If there are still people buying, they will keep wiping their asses with fat stacks of cash and flushing them down the toilet for some seagull to choke on later.

And then after /that/ realize that telling the people who you supposedly care so much for that you hate them for, well, not fitting what you say is worthy of care, isn't going to help. No amount of berating and hating those who are still buying fast food will fix the problem, because the problem you are talking about doesn't lie with the individual consumer. No one will listen to you seriously if you go around saying they deserve to die and their loved ones, whom aren't all also overweight, meaning you would treat them like actual human beings instead of sick livestock, deserve to suffer just by proxy.

Everything that you listed wouldn't have stopped the pandemic from happening had they never existed. COVID would still be here. Masks would still have to be worn. Vaccines would still need to be received. Hospitals beds would still be at capacity. People would still be suffering and people would still be dying.

Right now is not the time for a mass ""cleansing"" of the US population by denying the overweight treatment or sympathy, nor is it the time to blame them for it as they aren't to blame at all. They are as much a victim to the system you claim to hate so much that you condemn an entire group of people, as they are a victim to COVID or any other sickness.

I get your point, I even agree with some of it to an extent, which is why I took the time to share this and hopefully widen your perspective a bit to allow you take your energy and direct it towards something that can help mitigate the fast food industry from continuing to be as pervasive as it is in US culture. Thank you for taking the time to read this and, hopefully, seriously consider what I'm bringing to the table, even if you don't end up agreeing. Have a good one and stay safe.

We're already a few weeks in, so I'd say chances are decently low someone would move in now (but not zero), and in a few more weeks, you should be in the clear for this semester (not next one tho; I'd guess you would more likely than not get a roommate next semester since more people are likely coming on campus, unless the MSU covid situation goes to hell haha). I would say reread the email to see exactly what they're saying. I got one at the beginning that was pretty much like ""Expect a roommate since you have an empty bed"" or whatever, but I believe it'd be a more specific notification when the roommate actually is confirmed to move in.

If you pay to have the room to yourself, then they'll never move someone in.

Things might be different now, so I'm not sure how much of this applies still, but basically it was ""pay for room to yourself and know you won't get a roommate"" vs ""pay the normal rate, but might get a random roommate at a random time"".

If your financial situation is going to force you to cancel the lease, maybe you can renegotiate the lease with your landlord so they can avoid having a vacancy. That's probably not a very strong incentive for the landlord though, because the law is going to be on their side and they would probably be able to quickly fill the vacancy. You're doing the right thing by speaking to legal services, but the biggest issue is how to ensure the other half of the rent gets paid for the next however many months so that you don't have to abandon your lease.

It’s about a 10-12 minute walk from that area to the stadium. There are a couple of parking garages in that area. There are also parking lots north on Abbot from there.

Once you eat. Hit the 7-11 or Spartan Spirits and grab a six pack. Don’t open your beer until you cross M-43 and get on campus however. Open containers are verboten in East Lansing but are allowed on campus.

The administration should be working 24/7 to fix this.   They can start by closing the faculty dining areas and SERVING the students.  Hire some food trucks if they can’t figure it out im sure there are Lansing businesses that could use more business.  Step up MSU, this isn’t happening at other schools!!!

Your ability to get the most out of the RA position will likely depend on the degree of the lab manager's guidance and advising. If the prof running it is very hands on, they'll likely give you assignments and tasks and guide you through them. That's a bit of a rare situation, in my experience. In the more likely situation, the prof will be a bit more hands off and expect you to come to them. That is, with a hands off lab manager, you'll likely have to request tasks and guidance on how to do certain things. Don't be afraid to do so; it's the only way you'll learn. Also, don't be afraid to learn on the grad students in the lab. They're often working on theses or dissertations that they could use some help with. If you can manage to help them out, you will learn A TON.   


As for GRE, I will preface my answer by stating that different people will have different strategies that work best for them. I started with all the common GRE practice books. When I say I had them all and went through all of them, I mean it. Unfortunately, those didn't work very well for me. What I found to be the most useful was [magoosh.com](https://magoosh.com). That website helped boost my scores by \~20 points across GREV and GREQ. If you invest in it, make sure to go through every single question multiple times, take notes on the things that don't make sense, study the stuff that doesn't make sense until it does make sense, and then just practice practice practice. Also, and this is key, download their phone app so you can study words. If I remember correctly, they have about 2,000 flashcards for common GRE words used on the GREV. Make sure you know all of them. Then, when you know all of them, use a different app to make your own flashcards. Every time I found a word I wasn't familiar with, I made a flash card. In all, I think I had close to 3,000 words I memorized. Please keep in mind, though, that I was going for perfect scores. If you don't need near-perfect scores, you can probably tone that down a bit.

10060,"I did my undergrad at MSU and am working on my PhD at UCONN. The steps I took while at MSU were imperative to getting into a grad program. To echo others, research experience is very important if you want to go the PhD route. Gaining experience, however, can be harder than it sounds. You may have to really “put yourself out there.” That is, you may need to do a lot of asking around to join labs. And don’t be discouraged if you get some rejections along the way. If you are taking a course in the subject you’d like to study in grad school, reach out to the instructor and express your interest in joining a lab (better to do this in person, preferably during office hours). Even if the instructor is a grad student themselves, they may be able to put you in contact with someone who can help. A second option, if you’re not taking a class in the topic you’d like to go to grad school for, is to email the profs that do study what you’re interested in. Be sure to tell them you’re passionate about the subject, are interested in grad school, and would like to know if they’d be open to taking on an undergrad research assistant. In the email, also include something like “if you are not currently taking assistants, would you happen to know of anyone who is?” You may not get a reply, but don’t feel bad. Instead, simply email the next professor on your list. A final option is to talk to your undergrad advising office. Tell them you’d like to get into a research lab and they may be able to help you. 

Outside of research, professional experience can be very beneficial, depending on what you’re going into. I’d look into finding internships during your summers at MSU. Even if it’s only somewhat related to your intended field, it’s better than nothing. Depending on the market, you may have to do A LOT of looking around for an internship. 

Something else that I haven’t seen mentioned yet is the importance of studying for whatever standardized test you may have to take. If you’re required to take, say, the GRE to get into grad school, it’s best to start studying early and often. One of my biggest regrets is blowing off studying for the GRE. It took me more attempts than I’m comfortable admitting to get the score I needed to get into a good grad school. It wasn’t until I really sat down and spent the entire summer studying all day that I got the scores I needed for a top program in my field. If I had started earlier, I wouldn’t have had to put myself through so much agony that summer.

In all seriousness there's a few ways it can pan out- one way is that they wind up raising tuition prices, something they've already done this semester while cutting back on the services you're offered in exchange for said tuition.   


I gave a prior example in another thread involving mcdonalds workers in Denmark to better illustrate a real world situation- in 2014 in the US, average pay for mcdonalds workers is about 9-10 dollars an hour, with a lot of pushback from communities sand employees to up the wage to 15 an hour. A big mac on average cost about $4.80- but in denmark, thanks to successful and strong unionization efforts, as well as using their collective bargaining power as a whole, workers were able to bring their wages to about $20 usd an hour.  


A big mac there, at the time, cost only 35 cents more.  


The other option that the college will likely not pursue, is downsizing the salaries of some of it's most paid staff- professors at MSU would not be the first hit in this highly ideal scenario, as their collective ability to shoulder the financial burden isn't enough. But say for example, reducing the salary of our football coach, from \~$5,500,000? Or the members of the board of trustees, or president Stanley, with figures in the six digits?

EDIT: Also wanted to say, I know I’m not entitled to being served by people working for low wages.

If you're living in the dorms and shit, all the money you make at the college shouldn't be going right back *into* the college.  


Moreover, on call employees at the college can only work so many hours before they hit a ceiling/cap that the university placed, 1052 hours per year. Before taxes and just going off the flat 14/hour, that's 14k- taxes are about 15% or so on a paystub, which makes this closer to 12k yearly.

Here’s there email:

https://rhs.msu.edu/staff-directory

RHS,

A significant reduction of food services was announced on Wednesday, 9/21. MSU must understand its failure to deliver basic student needs is unacceptable. Both tuition and housing costs have risen but basic services have decreased.

MSU should take meaningful steps lessen student impact such as:

* Utilizing temp agencies
* Holding highly promoted job fairs with same day interviews and application reviews. \*
* Raising pay and perks to meet the demands of the market. University of Michigan’s starting salary for dinning services is 17 dollars an hour. The average line cook in the East Lansing area earns 16 dollars an hour.
* Paying current workers higher evening/weekend wages.
* Moving employees from other areas of the business to HR and Food Services until student needs are met.
* Spreading changes across campus, so one group of students isn’t impacted much more than others.

*There are reports of students applying for positions weeks ago and not receiving a response.

We ask MSU why N Neighborhood (Landon’s Heritage Commons) and Shaw students are disproportionately impacted by these changes. Landon students are currently required to walk a minimum of 90 minutes each Saturday and Sunday (round-trip) for meals and another 30-40 minutes every weekday evening. Why not distribute these changes across residences vs. focusing on 2 locations?

There are security and health issues present with MSU’s solution. Students do not feel safe walking alone at night and many students simply cannot walk the distance required due to disability. Secondly, trying to shuttling an entire neighborhood worth of students creating both a logistical nightmare and an extremely high Covid-19 risk.

After all MSU has been thru on student safety I would have hoped they would have made that their top priority, instead of ignoring complaints and making excuses.

its unbelievable that MSU allowed this to happen, they have free rent/facilities paid by my tax $ for gods sake.  Outside restaurants not only have to pay competitive wages, they have to pay rent and deliver returns to their investors - and somehow they are still open!  If MSU can’t figure it out they should open their cafeterias to outside restaurant services that know how to run a business, instead of leaving the cafeteria vacant for dinner.

A pay raise from 10 to 14, or in my case due to how long i've worked here less than a dollar, is what MSU had referred to in an RHS/Admin meeting as a competitive wage- if they wanted to do anything to genuinely solve the staffing crisis, they ought to abandon the idea of a competitive wage and pay people fairly, especially if they're going to be doing three times as much work due to the staffing shortage (speaking from current experience, i literally am covering for employees we don't have/receiving no additional pay for all the considerably extra work)  


Like- I feel as if that's not a hard thing considering members of the board/the football coach/president Stanley make ridiculously large figures that utterly dwarf a 25/h wage. If this was the only job I were working, or if I were paid fairly to compensate for the extra labor, a 25/h wage would literally pay my bills in full and also let me start saving for medical shit I need done- and within the 1052 hourly limit it STILL would only be 26,300 a year.

The professors are mostly pretty good, theres a good bit of just memorization in some classes but it’s nothing too difficult. 

The best part to me is its a degree where you shouldn’t have trouble finding a job after college, most students have a decent paying job lined up before their senior year even starts, and besides busy season (if you do public accounting) its a job that has a good amount of paid vacation time. I value stability a lot.

10739,"Hi I'm staff (not with RAHS, generic desk stuff elsewhere). I'm sorry you have to deal with this. I don't think people should have to pay so much money for the services promised to not be working, even though I understand that the pandemic makes it impossible for these services to function normally. It all sucks.

Just some info and thoughts:
Like someone said, RAHS is its own self-funded unit. They can't nab faculty and staff from other units. We're all under the MSU umbrella, but they are essentially their own business. While most people could serve food, HR positions are highly trained, professional roles, that most people cannot do without training, so just throwing bodies at HR isn't the solution. Temp agencies don't have enough temps to supply right now. I agree that more money needs to be paid to food workers, even outside of MSU. We should keep calling for it, but I don't think RAHS has the funds to make that happen right now. But we gotta keep calling for it.


Many MSU staff are unionized so you can't shift us around without second thought. RAHS have begged us to unpaid volunteer for move-in and dining shifts. From my perspective; I already spend 9 hours of my day trying to make MSU nicer for students. I'm not giving up more time from my family and passions, even if they paid. I'd quit if they made me expose myself to COVID serving tater tots after my long workday. You pay a lot in tuition, yes, but that's between you and Stanley, and I don't have to suffer for it.


I'm a little annoyed to be browsing reddit and see someone tell me that I should give up my evenings to cook food for him with a hundred upvotes. ""Moving employees from other areas of the business to HR and Food Services until student needs are met."" My needs matter too. I'm also in my 20s and want to die all the time and i don't make as much money as you probably think I do, and I definitely don't have as much power as you think I do. MSU staff and faculty are many cases folks just a little older than you with real struggles and burnout too, and we need jobs to feed our babies and pay our rent, and this is what we found for a job. MSU has obligations to both its students and staff, and they are both important, and staff obligations can't be slashed to put student ones on a pedestal.


""spread changes across campus"" many units, colleges, etc are their own business units with their own pools of money. You pose a good idea, though just like staff can't be moved to and fro, money can't either. Much of MSU's money is given to them with strings attached, and has to be used for certain purposes. I don't think it's wrong to pitch this idea though; it might help in some areas! But it might explain why MSU didn't do this to the degree one might hope.


If you do want to take this farther, start with RAHS. Start by asking questions, not making demands. This way, you will get the info you need to craft a persuasive message. When you send messages to Dr. Stanstan's desk that get basic facts wrong, like about RAHS having the same money pool as whatever, your message is disregarded quickly. If you ask questions and get a comprehensive understanding of the situation, and THEN craft your Persuasive Writing 101 Letter for Standaddy, it will be taken more seriously. Yes, people are listening. I hope things get better soon. I don't want things to be harder for students. They are lovely people. Also always be polite to the communicator from RAHS, this isn't her fault but she's the one who has to endure all the anger, and she definitely cares about this.",0.0427,0.2668,0.6905

Tomorrow (the 27th) is the last day to drop with refund. However, MSU is doing flat rate tuition now between 12-18 credits.

10766,"**An excerpt from True Allegiance, by Ben Shapiro:**


Then he heard the voice.

   “Hey, pig,” it said. The voice wasn’t deep. It was the voice of a child. And the
kid stood outside the door of the quick mart, legs spread, arms hanging down by
his sides. A cute black kid, wearing a Simpsons T-shirt and somebody’s old
Converse sneakers and baggy jeans.

   On his hip, stuck in those baggy jeans, was a pistol.

   It looked like a pistol, anyway. But O’Sullivan couldn’t see clearly. The light
wasn’t right. He could see the bulge, but not the object.

   O’Sullivan put his flashlight back in his belt and put his hand back on his
pistol, the greasy handle still warm to the touch.

   “Stop right there, pig,” the kid said. His hand began to creep down toward his
waistband.

   O’Sullivan pulled the gun out of its holster, leveling it at the kid. “Put your
hands above your head. Do it now!”

   “Fuck you, honky,” the kid shot back. “Get the fuck out of my neighborhood.”
Then he laughed, a cute kid’s laugh. O’Sullivan looked for sympathy behind
those eyes, found none.

   Oh, shit, O’Sullivan thought. Then he said, “Hands up. Right now.”

   The kid laughed again, a musical tinkling noise. “You ain’t gonna shoot me,
pig. What, you afraid of a kid?”

   O’Sullivan could feel every breath as it entered his lungs. “No, kid, I don’t
want to shoot you,” he said. “But I need you to cooperate. Put your hands above
your head. Right now.”

   The kid’s hand shifted to his waistband again. O’Sullivan’s hands began to
shake.

   “Get the fuck out of my neighborhood,” the kid repeated.

   O’Sullivan looked around stealthily. Still nobody on the street. Totally empty.
The sweat on his forehead felt cold in the night air. In the retraining sessions at
the station, they’d told officers to remember the nasty racial legacy of the
department, be aware of the community’s justified suspicion of police. Right
now, all O’Sullivan was thinking about was getting this kid with the empty eyes
to back the fuck off.

   “Go on home,” he said.

   “You go home, white boy,” said the kid. His hand moved lower.

   Suddenly, O’Sullivan’s head filled with a sudden clarity, his brain with a
preternatural energy. He recognized the feel of the adrenaline hitting. He wasn’t
going to get shot on the corner of Iowa and Van Dyke outside a shitty
convenience store in a shitty town by some eight-year-old, bleed out in the gutter
of some city the world left behind. He had a life, too.

   The gun felt alive in his hand. The gun was life.

   The muzzle was aimed dead at the kid’s chest. No way to miss, with the kid
this close, just ten feet away maybe. Still cloaked in the shadow of the gas
station overhang.

   “Kid, I’m not going to ask you again. I need you to put your hands on top of
your head and get on your knees.”

   “Fuck you, motherfucker.”

   “I’m serious.”

   The kid’s hand was nearly inside his waistband now.

   “Don’t do that,” O’Sullivan said.

   The kid smiled, almost gently.

   “Don’t.”

   The kid’s smile broadened, the hand moved down into the pants. “Get the
fuck out of my hood,” the kid cheerfully repeated. “I’ll cap your ass.”

   “Kid, I’m warning you,” O’Sullivan yelled. “Put your hands above your head!
Do it now…”

   The roar shattered the night air, a sonic boom in the blackness. The shot blew
the kid off his feet completely, knocked him onto his back.

   O’Sullivan reached for his radio, mechanically reported it: “Shots fired,
officer needs help at the gas station on Iowa and Van Dyke.”

   “Ohgodohgodohgodohgod,” O’Sullivan repeated as he moved toward the
body, the smoke rising from his Glock. He pointed it down at the kid again, but
the boy wasn’t moving. The blood seeped through Homer Simpson’s face,
pooled around the kid’s lifeless body. The grin had been replaced with a look of
instantaneous shock. His hand had fallen out of his waistband with the force of
the shooting.

   In it was a toy gun, the tip orange plastic.

   For a brief moment, O’Sullivan couldn’t breathe. When he looked up, he saw
them coming. Dozens of them. The citizens of Detroit, coming out of the
darkness, congregating. He could feel their eyes.

   Officer Ricky O’Sullivan sat down on the curb and began to cry.

The vaccine does help, but it’s not going to eradicate COVID anytime soon—hence the Delta variant—so a combination of the vaccine, basic hygiene common sense, and my own naturally occurring immune system is really all I can trust. And since I have those, I’m not afraid of the coronavirus, no matter how much I’m told to fear it. If people don’t want the protection of the vaccine, I believe that should be their choice. Not the choice I would make, but their choice nonetheless, and they can deal with the consequences of that choice. I got the vaccine for me, not for “all of us.”

Of all the places I’ve been in the last few months, only MSU still requires masks for healthy people. (Indeed, attempts at my church back at home to reinstate a mask policy were met with an overwhelmingly negative response from people who are tired of this dragging on and on.) And since nothing outside of the buildings on campus requires masks, the mask policy is trivial to circumvent, which makes it ineffective.

As far as I can tell, MSU has pretty much given up. They can’t keep doubling down on COVID measures and keep their bottom line happy. So they’ve kept a few policies from last year and resumed mostly normal operations to bring in the money again, and the policies simply cover their asses if anyone asks what they’re doing to fight COVID.",0.0583,0.3808,0.5609
10808,"Results

A total of 21 studies met our inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses suggest that mask use provided a significant protective effect (OR = 0.35 and 95% CI = 0.24–0.51). Use of masks by healthcare workers (HCWs) and non-healthcare workers (Non-HCWs) can reduce the risk of respiratory virus infection by 80% (OR = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.11–0.37) and 47% (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.36–0.79). The protective effect of wearing masks in Asia (OR = 0.31) appeared to be higher than that of Western countries (OR = 0.45). Masks had a protective effect against influenza viruses (OR = 0.55), SARS (OR = 0.26), and SARS-CoV-2 (OR = 0.04). In the subgroups based on different study designs, protective effects of wearing mask were significant in cluster randomized trials and observational studies

CAPS is free, and if they refer you to MSU psychiatric services, I believe the first 4 appointments through them are also free, after which they bill your insurance or help you set up an appointment through someone outside of MSU.

I will add though, you know your entire schedule at the start of the semester. Every date and show is printed out and handed to you so you’ll know in September how often you’ll be working all the way through December.

It was an awesome job. It's closer to minimum wage, but you get paid to see shows in some cases. I've basically seen every Broadway that's been in East Lansing since 2018 and been paid to do so, in addition to many orchestras and famous musicians (most notably Bob Dylan). There's a bit of a learning curve though, because you do have to become very familiar with the functionings of a large and very well known performing arts venue. There are so many people though, between your student supervisors and house management staff, around to help you.

The hours can be a little sporadic sometimes (only a few shifts in February for example, compared to more when a long Broadway run is happening) however you have a lot of people you work with able and available to take shifts and vice versa. Sometimes you do have to work late nights, not getting out until 11-11:30pm. But it is truly a fun job with a tight community of usher friends. If you like working with other people (it is ultimately a customer service job) and are able and willing to stand for sometimes hours at a time, I would suggest it.

It's entire job is to help you learn to think in the abstract, and once you start getting a better handle on what they're saying, it shifts the way you think about problem solving and makes you a better programmer as a result. It's very different from the classes you've had up until now, so it throws people for a loop sometimes. So don't feel bad about that.

But also know that this is one of the CSE classes that you absolutely cannot slack on (not saying you are, just calling this out). The concepts build on each other and if you don't keep up it becomes that much harder to catch up.

I'd recommend two things:

* Go back through your old assignments/topics starting from the beginning of the class. Reread everything, go over your notes (you absolutely need to be taking notes in college if you aren't already. No exceptions). Make absolutely sure you understand everything up to that point. As soon as you find something you don't understand, dig into that and do some practice problems. And seriously, I remember hating having to do this and rarely got myself to do it, but fact is you're paying for college. You're an adult. You should want to get what you pay for, and some of that means just doing the work not for points and not because it's assigned but because it's something that will help you reach your goals.

* Go to office hours. Ask questions after class. Again. They're there as resources for you to be used. Be sure to take advantage",0.1924,0.4744,0.3332

11357,"I understand how you’re seeing this, but you’re brushing over a major housing problem in East Lansing. Management companies and well-off parents have been buying up the houses in the neighborhoods (especially North, but also West) closest to MSU for student housing. This has pushed a lot of us “townies” (many of whom are from EL and/or work for MSU) out of these EL neighborhoods because this demand drives up prices.

I am a young (mid 20’s) recent MSU grad who is also from EL. I now work for the University and can no longer live in EL. I have to commute from a nearby community because of housing costs there and it is unlikely that I will get to be a homeowner in my city any time soon. This is also the case for many of my colleagues, some of whom are also from EL. Others choose to pay the high prices for the tiny apartments or have many roommates to cover costs. These are full-time working adults.

Students would be just fine living a few years in an apartment and leave the houses and neighborhoods open for the long-term residents. You can look at the rental houses and see that short-term occupants (like students) and fiscally interested parties (like mgmt companies) just don’t take care of these houses or neighborhoods like the long-time individual homeowners; or they tear down the houses completely to build apartments or townhomes.

Lol. , But after awhile, years ago, I slowly started realizing more and more how obnoxious ppl at big events can be, especially driving by and seeing them from the outside, without the bias of it being ppl you know. (( No, Not EVERY person acts ridiculous, and I'm sure I'll get down voted but I don't care AT ALL)), but fr, enough ppl DO get obnoxious that it just turns me off to frats or parties or whatever bar / BS most of the time. 
so much of it--- It's just so fake, too;, ppl trying to just get laid or look cool, yelling, outdrinking each other, believe he, the FOMO dissipates.. drunk clickish MSU kids pretending to look like they're chill af, but they're trying SO hard lol. It's funny if you look at it from the outside awhile. It's awful for late night for workers , too!! Believe that lol

And then when you drive through East Lansing and can't go through a green light cuz some drunk frat guys or screaming sorority girls are randomly jumping in the road, trying to look hot, while falling over puking,  thinking they're all so cool and interesting , ((mostly they're boring af )) and acting entitled as fuck, belligerent as hell, putting on airs, -- yea the FOMO clears up, trust me. 

 Some parties can be great, if you're into that, but if not, ok, that's totally fine---there's literally thousands of students here who quietly don't go partying n bar hopping every weekend,, so don't worry, you're not alone on that.  Idgaf if  it's not ""cool"" or whatever to say u you don't love parties or don't like drinking or smoking weed, who cares though, I mean, you do you.

11510,"Don’t worry, this feeling is completely normal and the majority of students at MSU are experiencing the same thing. In an age of FOMO, comparison is the thief of joy. 

I was in the very same situation as you many (many) years ago. I realized that their kind of fun just wasn’t for me. Plus, I took my major seriously and the fallout from partying was unsustainable. So, I found people who might not have been exactly like me (and that’s a good thing), but who liked the same music and we all started going to local shows, for example. But at this time, I know venues, etc., are limited. Here are my modest suggestions while you’re feeling things out: 

1. Get in where you fit in. MSU has a lot of student groups and they don’t require a ton of commitment. I joined a bunch, even if for a short time. (Do we still have a Rube Goldberg team? That was fun.) If you live on campus, I recommend getting involved with student government (e.g. West Circle Caucus) and dorm-based student groups. If you’re into music, the campus radio station has student volunteers running and hosting its shows. They seem to have a lot of fun off the clock. 

2. Surprisingly, finding a job is another place to find community. As weird as it sounds, you can get to know people pretty quickly through a part-time job. 

3. Don’t be afraid to go out by yourself! I met awesome people when I started doing things alone. Plus, there’s a lot of value in learning how to be happy while you’re by yourself. It’s a skill that has helped me later in life. 

TL;DR: Everyone experiences this at some point. It really sucks, but try not to let their choices color yours. You’re probably into awesome things that make you happy, right? Do those things. I guarantee you aren’t alone!",0.828,0.1488,0.0232

11554,"I hear you there. It's hard not to lose faith when it seems like even when we ""win"" it feels at best like a draw in terms of the policies that are enacted.

To me, the definition of Progressivism has changed over the last decade. It used to simply mean that you checked all of the Dem boxes, and weren't a Democrat that was anti-choice or pro-gun. It has now grown to mean so much more from a policy standpoint, on issues such as health care, economic equity, etc.

To me, the simplest definition I can give for Progressivism is that it is a political ideology that places the other over the self. That is to say, it is grounded in the idea that we should all care for and provide for each other, and promote laws and policies that do that.

I'll admit I'm a recent convert to the cause. For a number of years I was in the, ""we have to be practical and there's no chance these pie in the sky things will ever happen so get on board with the moderates and compromise"" camp. The Trump presidency shook that mindset out of me completely. I've realized that if you're not fighting for what you truly believe in then you're not really fighting.

My view on how change becomes possible is that you have to start local, and show people that these ideas are great and worth pushing for. As more and more cities implement real police reform, for example, and people see that the sky isn't falling apart, they will begin to become more open to those ideas at higher levels of government. You also have to work to build a bench of candidates. Local progressive elected officials have a better chance of winning a state office and then in turn a federal office.

The dell could really have any internal hardware configuration, so you'll need to follow the instructions for windows or Linux to find out the speed of the network card inside.

Read write is important for accessing files on your computer, isn't a measurement used for networking so I think that figure you're giving is disk speed not network speed. 

Run the test. Nothing gets done unless you actually do some testing and troubleshooting. If things are faster when bypassing the wifi router plugging directly into the fiber modem, then the issue is 100 percent the wifi router. In my experience, TP link makes shitty routers. 1250 sometimes isn't good enough. My friend was using a similarly specter router when having issues with their speed that replacing the router resolved. You could also try doing a factory reset, or follow [TP Links troubleshooting instructions](https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/faq/2170/).

11638,"It's likely your networking equipment, fortunately there's an easy way for you to test this yourself. Try hardwiring a computer directly in to the Spartan Net modem (where the fiber comes into the apartment, best way is unplug from the router input WAN and into the Ethernet port of a laptop) and run a speedtest ([speedtest.net](www.speedtest.net), [fast.com](fast.com) [speedof.me](speedof.me)). You need to do this with a hardwire Ethernet connection. You should get something much closer (900ish Mbps) if everything is alright from the ISP. If you get a slower speed, call them back and tell them you plugged a computer directly into the modem and report the up and down speeds you tested at. If you get high speed plugged directly in, the problem is likely your router. If you determine it's your router, you'll need a new one.  I recommend the [UniFi Dream Machine](https://store.ui.com/collections/unifi-network-unifi-os-consoles/products/unifi-dream-machine). Spartan Net should also give you an option of renting a compatible router. The Dream Machine is a little pricy, but it is going to work and be the most reliable experience plus is able to be easily expanded upon if you're in a larger house that needs more access points somewhere in the future. If you want to ignore my recommended router, anything AC1200 or higher should work, but I can't guarantee how well

There's also a slight possibility that your computers networking hardware doesn't support gigabit speed (friend got a new computer from Costco, Ethernet limited to 10/100, it's why it's worth checking even on a new device), this can be quickly determined by following the relevant instruction on [Windows](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-determine-wi-fi-and-ethernet-connection-speed-windows-10), [MacOS](https://austinmacworks.com/check-ethernet-connection-speed-mac/), or [Ubuntu Linux](https://askubuntu.com/questions/431911/how-can-i-verify-the-speed-of-my-nic-in-ubuntu) (if you've got another Linux distro, you should be familiar with how to look up instructions)

P.S. my aforementioned friend whom purchased a new laptop with a shitty nic also had problems receiving his full internet speed on a gigabit fiber connection with a different provider. Very similar to the issue you describe. Replacing his old router with a UniFi Dream Machine solved everything (when testing with a computer capable of gigabit speed).

11673,"That's a great question. On the one hand people are asking for less police enforcement of certain offenses, but also don't want loud parties, etc.

To me, the city already has an answer built in through its Parking And Code Enforcement (PACE) division. PACE currently handles issues involving litter, snow removal, lawn maintenance and trash/recycling can storage. My view would be to empower them to take on more issues like parties, fireworks, and those types of issues. 

When people say they don't want enforcement of non-violent offenses, what I think they specifically mean is that they don't want the POLICE doing it. So many instances of police violence, as we've seen, often start with something simple like a broken taillight that then escalates. I don't think you need an officer with a gun to go to a house party and tell them to shut it down. A PACE officer can come in and say, ""hey you've got 15 minutes to wrap this up and if you don't you'll be getting a citation."" Heck, if you want to send Councilmember DeLay over there just give me a call.

Enhancing PACE was an idea that was brought up by Council last year, but ultimately didn't get traction. I think we should bring that idea back.

The bottom line is that I think we can still provide enforcement, but we can find alternative enforcers.",0.0563,0.4025,0.5412

11687,"I do not believe that the police union contract greatly inhibits the ability to achieve this goal. First, I should note that my plan does not call for a reduction in officers (and I would want to keep jail employees with the dept in a different capacity). When I talk about 25% I'm talking about the department's budget, not the number of officers. Additionally my focus is on the department's specific operating budget, not the retirement benefits that are included under the personnel line item (an issue that I consider to be separate and part of the larger pension question). If you look at 2020 to 2021 it looks like the department's budget was cut by something like $750,000+, when in reality much of that was just a reduction in retirement costs attributed to the department that was absorbed by income tax revenue. I don't really count that as a reduction, because I could just divert more of that cost to be covered by a different revenue source and pretend that I'm reforming police when in reality it's just moving numbers around.

When the council debated the issue of spending around $10,000 for replacing tear gas canisters that wasn't something that is covered by the contract, and if they'd have decided not to budget for it that would have been that. The same would go for the issue the council faced over purchasing new vests, or if we were looking at purchasing new vehicles, etc. In other words, many budgetary items are not subject to the union contract. While determining the future of the jail employees could be an issue, as well as looking at moving social workers and the Neighborhood Service Officers into a new department could require some negotiating, I am confident that any issues that would arise from a contract stand point can be negotiated in good faith.

All of the above being said, I am more than willing to work collaboratively with the police department on my proposal. If there are things that they would like to have taken off of their plate or budget items they say they can live without, all for the better. My goal hear isn't to be punitive towards the police, but rather to provide over all better public service.",0.1474,0.6116,0.241

11818,"To clarify, there is a wall plate in your apartment that the internet comes from, and you've got your wifi router plugged into that? When you test, you get the same speeds with both?

If this is the case, there is other networking equipment in your building that you may or may not have access to. The apartment complex likely has a networking room where the fiber comes into the building with a fiber modem/ont. From there, the data is probably traveling through a firewall, before going into a switch to divide up the traffic to different apartments before plugging into a patch panel which will be the other end of your wall plate.


Start by calling the ISP. Tell them what speed you are getting hardwired into the wall port of your apartment. They might have access to this networking room already or be able to get in contact with the right people for you. You are paying for gigabit speed, you shouldn't barely be getting a quarter of that. If you want to get cheeky, offer them a quarter of the bill until it's fixed.  

If they come back and say they can't do anything or it's the building, then you can try asking the landlord, or building manager, or maybe maintenance, to try troubleshooting this issue but idk how likely they will be. You'll probably need to initiate contact on about a daily basis until you get a report back.  At the minimum, I would ask them to reboot the fiber modem, firewall, and switch. Secondary questions I would have are what kind of Ethernet cabling do they use in the walls and in the networking room? If the building is old enough, it may not meet gigabit requirements (needs to be cat5e or higher). Finally, your end speed could also be the result of everyone else in your building using the internet, however if your ISP technician was able to get 700 plugged into your wall port, the building may have something like a 10gb line coming into the building.  If you know any of your neighbors in your building, it would help if you're able to get them to run a speedtest like you have, hardwired into where the internet enters the apartment.",0.0656,0.5887,0.3457

Pictures don't show up on the screen, so no worries about that. However there are some cases where the ID doesn't scan when tapped and they take it themselves and swipe it on the register. Could be a case where someone picks up something obvious (ex a girl using a boy's ID) and rejects it. 

Student employees are much more lax with a lot of school policies from my experiences, so your already high chances of success will skyrocket if thats the case.

Keep in mind I'm pretty sure there are some strict punishments if you do get caught using someone else's ID, but even in those cases the person at the register will let it slide and just make your friend pay.

Based on some really arbitrary numbers in my head, assuming your friend doesn't look completely different from you (same gender, same race) you'll probably have a 95% chance to get away with it.

I already feel like it’s been months into the year. Been going to bed almost everyday at 1-3am just trying to get my done. (I will admit, I don’t have nowhere near the best work/time management habits/ethics.  (Have also seen multiple people on my dorm floor in the bathroom at 12,1,2,3,4 am daily lol,so maybe I’m not the only one). 

I’m a junior music student, and my schedule is so packed. I’m only taking 14 credits because music courses are unfairly low credit-wise, and I can’t max out my courses because I have to practice my instruments about 5hours daily. (My schedule isn’t the fairly typical person with four to five 3-4credit courses in their schedule). I have about 25 hours of “classes/rehearsals/“things” to attend weekly (not including my practicing). And my three courses that are actually “typical class room structured” have 80% of the weekly assignments due on the same day, Sunday night. My lightest day is 4hours of things to attend, plus each of my days start at 9am. 
For me it’s an endless weekly cycle of trying to get my hw done on time, and practice as much as I can cause that’s what I gotta do, and then it starts over again and there’s no down time. I’ve hung out with friends less than 10 times and I haven’t done any fun activities yet really. 

(Small rant, but I hate how msu has so many slightly bs pre-req/academic courses required. I’ve already gone through high school doing math,science, history, English, classes that don’t  benefit my major in any way what so ever and I don’t need more just so you can make more money off of me. there are so many other courses that benefit my major that I don’t have the time to schedule that I would love to take so it can better prepare me for my future career. (I’m not sure how an IAH210 Asia and the world class or an isb 202 organisms and the environment class will help me win a professional orchestral audition so I can play my classical music that I enjoy for the rest of my life, or help me win a university level teaching job, or all the other opportunities in my field, but please let me know how it will help).

Also you do not need to grab one of each letter in order to qualify it as a combo. If you're feeling like just getting a drink, snack or entree by itself you can use your combo for that as well.

I believe social workers are required to be licensed through the state. I’m not sure if the city helps pay for their education but I would be open to that.

It took 10 years to see the effects, but it clearly made an impact on their clientele's health.

When you go to a dermatologist they make you sign papers for it to begin treatment. There's a reason for that. It's a big packet to go through with pages upon pages of side effects. It's very clear when you see this packet that this ""medication"" is very serious business. That stuff is straight poison.

You would be far better served in joining a skin care sub or looking on YouTube for natural skincare regimens. Take a look at these things while keeping your ancestry in mind because some things work better for different groups of people.

I'm not saying that a natural skincare regimen will be a magic bullet, but I do believe it will clear you up once you figure out what products are going to work for you. Small things like even changing your soap, getting more sun, or cutting out certain foods can result in big changes, but just like anything it takes time + trial and error.

For the PhD program, though, I'm not sure where this perception would be coming from. The standards for admission into any grad program are somewhat high, because they only want to accept students that they think will succeed and resources are limited, but I don't think CSE's standards are out of line with comparable programs. I'm wondering if maybe some people who are finding it unexpectedly challenging are not familiar with some of these aspects of the process:

* The CSE PhD program is mostly what is called a ""direct admit"" program, which means you're more applying to work with a specific professor than to be in the program in general. There are some exceptions to this, but for the most part if you want to do your PhD in this department you should start by reaching out to professors that you want to work with and identifying at least one who seems interested in working with you.
* In academia, there is a general bias against doing your PhD where you went to college or getting a faculty position where you did your PhD. I'm not sure that this really factors into admissions decisions for the CSE PhD program, but it might.
* You mentioned wanting to apply for a masters + PhD, but that's not actually how it works here. You apply for one or the other. It's True that after getting a masters you can decide to try to do your PhD here as well (more common if you're doing a research-based masters and decide you want to stay in the same lab), but if you know you want to get a PhD there isn't much reason to apply for the masters program.",0.095,0.5633,0.3417

12292,"&gt;Would it be hard to transfer in?

No, but that's all relative.

&gt; How’s the college overall?

I transferred out of MSU after my freshman year, so I can only speak about CoRe. If you're transferring from a community college and haven't taken an ""intro to engineering"" course yet, you're probably going to have to take Engn 100. This course teaches you the engineering mindset (stages of design, ethical dilemmas in engineering, report writing, teamwork etc). The class is what you make of it. Some people go all out on their design projects, but you can honestly have a shit project and write a good report about it and pass if you really wanted to. Above all else, this class exposes you to how engineering works in the real world (a bunch of people with different skill level figuring out out to solve a problem). You might also learn basic cad.

Since you're transferring, I assume you have most of your prereqs out of the way (chemistry, math, physics, etc.). If you've taken an OOP programming class, you can probably cash it in for CS 231 credit and get your computing requirement out of the way.

From what I've heard, at least for chemE, the upper level engineering courses are A LOT harder than the prereqs. The prereqs at MSU, with the exception of chem 151 and CS 231, are easier to ace than at other schools. They try not to weed people out.

I really appreciate how much emphasis the school gives towards undergraduate education for the intro courses. SV and MV calculus are taught extremely well here and the classes are pretty fair in difficulty (to put it into perspective, u of m has random graduate students teach calc 1-2 and gives ridiculous ""weeder"" problems on tests, msu has dedicated instructors and the tests were fair game). Another example is how undergraduate science courses are taught. My dynamics/vibrations class wasn't lecture based. We worked in small groups of four (headed by a TA) on individual problem sets and were given capstone projects instead of tests, and i liked that better. Chem 141, the intro to chemistry section, is also taught with an approach to avoid scaring people from the subject (can't speak about this personally, but i hear great things about it).",0.5437,0.3564,0.0999

* Similarly, the bike ride to downtown along river walk is nice.
* Harris nature center and Legg park are across the street from each other and run along a river. The trails are slightly more groomed at Harris and there is a place where you walk over a swamp that feels like a ghost army should rise out of it. Legg has a hill so it is one of the few trails near campus with some elevation, and it feels less travelled and you see less people.
* Lake Lansing North is a longer trail than most around Lansing, and surrounded by river and swamp. Just bring bug spray if it isn't cold, as the bugs can be a lot sometimes. It sometimes costs to get in.
* There are some trails behind the meridian mall, but I found them worse than most of the other local trails.
* Sleepy Hollow state park is about 40 min north of campus and has a decent sized in land lake with a bunch of trails and a path that goes around the lake. There is also a small island you can walk to. This was one of my favorite place to bring a picnic lunch, sit and look at the lake then go for a couple hour walk.

South East from campus:
* The arb in Ann arbor is amazing, and a great place to go walk around.
* Kensington metropark is an awesome place all around with some awesome walks and a lot of different birds. $10 to get in.
* There are a string of state parks and recreation areas between Lansing and Detroit. I love bald mountain, seven lakes, and proud lake. Island lake was nice too, but I didn't like the main loop as much.

West from campus:
* Grand Ledge and Lincoln Park have actual cliffs and some great walks.
* Not a ton between there and grand rapids.
* The state parks along Lake Michigan (except grand Haven) all have some really great hikes. Plus lake Michigan is amazing. 

Up North:
* The Ludington Manistee area is amazing. Ludington state park is my favorite place on earth (3 hour drive ish), and has a huge mess of trails, different lakes and rivers, and a light house. Manistee state forest has some great hikes, and is a little more rustic. This may be on the edge of a day trip.

Farther than a day trip:
* Sleeping bear, Taquemenon Falls, and Pictured rocks are the most beautiful places in the state in my opinion.",0.892,0.0943,0.0137

Closer, there are random parks and such as you head towards Grand Rapids or Ann Arbor/Detroit. Both are fun urban areas as well. I’d say Grand Rapids is better if you want a smaller/more chill city. Reed’s Lake and the Grand River are nice and there are good walking trail areas dotted around. I recently did a trip to Holland and then stopped in GR for dinner and the evening.

You gotta fumble for it and unwind it in what is likely going to be a sudden maneuver in the first place and that’s before you even start trying to use it. Martial arts/some self defense tactics teach you how to either neuter certain maneuvers or turn them on somebody without the need to fumble for a weapon. 

 Plus even just having pepper spray/showing some decent resistance can be a deterrent for an attacker to think “not worth it, pick an easier target” or “disengage or flee”, having the knife just escalates the situation and pushes fight or flight a lot more into the “fight” direction. Deterrence is generally the safer option. 

Also please don’t shoplift weapons, that’s a really bad look if you get caught and not a good one in general. 

If you *really* want to be legally dubious buy a taser instead, still gotta fumble with it but one sting and you got some time to try running and screaming and calling for help. And that’s if they even want to engage with you after finding out you have a taser.

If you are on a tight budget, you can DIY a couple with a drill and a bunch of screws. There are plenty of YouTube videos that tell you how.

2. Bolt-on fenders. These will keep your frame relatively clean from salt, which is important if you want to have a working frame by the end of March. Fenders will also keep you dry. Last thing you want is a spray of ice-cold water shoot up your bottom.

However, we will have that extra stock on hand, so if someone who gets a free shirt wants to purchase another one on the spot, they can do it today for the discounted price of $10, before we go back to selling these for $15 for the rest of the season for both in person and online sales. We get some folks who will ask to get one for their friend when they grab their free shirt, so having it available to buy at a discounted proce is a happy halfway point, as we’d like to make sure everyone later today gets the size they want. HOWEVER, if you come today and we are somehow out of your size, we will still give you a free tshirt if you’re one of the first 50 people to show up for one, and if you like, you can come by our office this week to exchange it for the correct size after we print more early this week after we get more blanks in.

12551,"Are you kidding me? I grew up in rough areas of queens and hung out with people in even tougher areas of queens, I have been jumped and mugged before I’ve been to college, I went to MSU and lived in lansing/east lansing for 6 years, I now live in south east Michigan and work in Detroit. Not a single damned time did I think, oh I need a weapon to defend my self. Not a single time I’ve walked away from the situation, thinking “man I wish I had a weapon.” 

This is terrible fucking advice for more than a few reasons, but chief among them is if you find your self in a potentially risky situation, you find away to leave, if you can’t leave you find a way to  de-escalate, if you can’t de-escalate, and only if you can’t de-escalate do you use your weapon. 

The thing people don’t tell you is that when someone wants to attack you, you know it. They have a body language that you can spot a mile away. The times I’ve been mugged, I saw the attacker and immediately knew something was going to go down. It’s a subconcious response, but as soon as you can recognize it, then you know to turn the other way. 

The guaranteed way to turn any altercation into a fight for your life is for you to turn that fight into a fight for your life. I have seen people produce knifes durring a fist fight, and then get stabbed themselves. A buddy of mine fought back durring a mugging and then had a gun produced on him. Again, avoidance is the best defense. 

That’s not even the worst part of your whole rant, the worst part is that most assaults that you’re describing are sexual assaults that are perpetrated by some one you know. The perpetrator is not some rando creepy guy hiding in a bush waiting for a sexy coed to walk by. It’s the guy buying you drinks all night, or your friend from down the hall. A weapon is useless in these situations. They disarm you first by using drinks or drugs. They don’t attack you. Learn how to avoid those situations. 

As for domestic abuse and relationship advice, that’s a whole other topic. The advice there is harder than “get a weapon lol.” This is way more phycological than it is violence.

You want to learn to defend your self? Great. I encourage you to take a real self defense class. One taught by an instructor who understands your bodies reactions to things and help you recognize what you need to be doing. Carrying a knife is not it.",0.0135,0.1512,0.8353

In this area, and on campus, Verizon should have the best coverage (not necessarily the best service -- their internet in this area isn't the fastest). Really, the only dead spots outside of buildings I'm aware of is closer to Baker Wood Lot.

Second best in coverage is T-Mobile at this point. Generally, their network is the fastest. This is more of a product of Sprint and Tmo merging their networks. You will want a new phone for their network for sure -- even people who have a two year old phone with them won't get 50% of the frequencies/towers they should be able to access.

Now, that doesn’t mean you won’t have it. MSU has a history of doing legacy stuff. That is, if you have access to something (email for example) they will keep it as long as you stay active with it.  That being said, they also tend to cut certain things off (academic journals, expert training videos).  It could just be that I never filled out the proper stuff when it switched over, but I can confirm that I do not have it. Then again, I finished grad school in 2012.

Edit: it was Udrive. I’ll have to mess with it when I’m at my computer to see if I can somehow get it to transfer over for me.

Edit 2: So, this morning, I tried to download the OneDrive App and sign in using my MSU ID and it confirmed that I do not have access to this service.  Yours may be a different case since you have already had access to the OneDrive system.  For those who did not have access, or didn't migrate over, it looks like it's a no go.

The class was just brutal, and the lack of individualized attention made it incredibly challenging to learn if you fell at all behind. I'm glad that they are using much more approachable languages/tools now (that we didn't have access to back then), but it's still unfortunate to hear that 20 years later, they're still employing the concept of ""weeder"" classes, which is exactly how it was described back then.

And this isn't just a criticism of CSE 231, but much of how university curriculum is delivered in general. Kids are paying $50,000+ to learn, and they deserve better than what they're getting for that investment.

Universities would be doing both employers and students a major disservice to make weeder classes easier.

&gt;Students are paying $50,000+ for a degree.

They come in different colors. Also get a cheap plastic drop cloth. Put the drop cloth in a box that fits the jug, something in recycling will do, and then the jug with the cap on. Get a solo cup and with your colors, slowly add the colors one at a time in the single cup. You'll only be pouring the paint in from the $1 tubes and not mixing it. However amount of that color you want to add is up to you. But once you have enough paint pour it on the jug starting with the cap and it should have a cool effect going down. Just be aware that gravity will pull the paint down so that could cause problems or solutions. [It's called Acrylic Pour Art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58XEfDtU0Z4)

Another option would be the same type of paints but you get some cheap brushes and  some really thin painters tape or scot's tape. This means it's not as wide and covers less stuff. Start with a black base coat and once it dries, you can start. Just go ham. There's no reason to stick to a pattern as you're painting something abstract. Even turn it into a drinking game or something where you choose colors from it. But just go ham turning it into something. Use tape to get [straight lines](https://imgur.com/a/58xKDW7) and if you use the tape over dried paint, you can do weird layering like in that photo.  But just make something unique all around.

Some really helpful tools:$.53 paint bottles: that come in different colors for the price, in the craft section of Wal-marts, there are two.Get a cheap paint brush set: Honestly I just got to Michaels and get my brushes from their check out isle. The big ones work fine.A plastic drop cloth: are a $1 at the dollar tree. They have painting supplies at them too just crap quality.A hair drier: will dry the acrylic paint much faster and make it easier to work with. And everyone should have one anyway. Cheap at thrift stores.A separate toothbrush: When you pull your thumb along the bristles of the brushes be it tooth or paint, will cause a splatter shot effect with little paint particles along the painting.

But yea, just some simple stuff to stand out with your jug at the party. If you go with the idea's I mentioned, just remember that it's abstract. Which means even a imperfection can cause it to look breathtaking.

Edit: I'm not creative enough to do anything other than abstract so I just realized you could totally just paint like, pumpkins or some crap for less effort and time.",0.2716,0.5769,0.1515

13531,"Two reasons. 

First, for some of the advanced classes I teach, the instructor copy only comes with answers, not full solutions. I like to be able to check my work on those problems for if a student needs help, and the chegg solutions are one way to do that (though they're sometimes not super helpful for those classes). I have a lot of responsibilities as an instructor, so I often don't have the time to beat my head against the problems in the way students are expected to do. Being able to check the solutions saves me a lot of time that I devote to hand-grading all my assignments and making my lessons more effective and more engaging, as well as frequent 1-on-1 meetings to help students work through problems. In short, the time saved my having those solutions available helps me devote more time to being a better teacher.

Second, I have a lot of show work homeworks in introductory physics, so the students can get practice showing their work before the exams. SO MANY students just copy down the solutions from chegg. This creates two problems. 1) The students aren't actually getting practice working through the problems, so they won't get better at solving physics problems, and that usually means they fall behind as the term goes on and often fail exams horribly when they don't have chegg to copy from. 2) Copying down a solution you find online is academic dishonesty, and I have to report things like that. I usually just give out a bunch of zeroes the first time it happens, and give the talk about the responsible way to use online solutions to support your learning without it becoming cheating. The lowest couple HW scores drop, so the zero won't hurt their grade in the course overall. This also lets me appear nice, because I don't report the first offense, but I get to scare all of them by promising to report any further issues to the university. This GREATLY cuts down on the cheating in my classes, and only a handful of students have ever cheated in that way a second time in my 7 years of teaching at this level.",0.1596,0.4226,0.4178

I'm taking this class with you as well, and there is a lot of information that she covers. Because it's open note, I utilized this for the nitpicky details that are just brute memorization (vitamin names, structures, effects of deficiencies, etc). 

However, you're going to really have to know the pathways inside and out. There is no getting around this, and the next unit will have even more enzyme/metabolites. 10000% supplement her videos with Ninja Nerd Lectures. I used this when studying for my MCAT, and it has made this class a breeze.

Her lecutres make it hard to see ""the bigger picture"", which is something I feel these videos do well. They are lengthy, but it's SO nice being able to visualize the pathways in color.

13733,"In short, people are being assholes here.

A group of 10 people is intimidating for sure but two groups of 5 people led by an MSU student in each with 1 girl in each group may not be as intimidating.

Either way, there should be some pretty large tailgates held at some houses or frats that are so large, they wouldn't notice or care about 10 extra people coming in. 

The trick is actually getting into the party in the first place because once you are in, you are usually set.

Two options for getting in is either sneaking in or making your group less intimidating.

So faculty and other academic appointments plus many non-support staff (research assistants, post docs, minions) can be bullied into slavery. Most full time support staff, like clerical, administrators, facilities, and skilled trades are union and will tell RHS to pound sand. 

However, RHS had better be careful. Most of the RHS full time staff are union and if they are losing out on potential overtime hours to slave labor then they have a right to grieve lost wages.

14050,"Although my 2 cents may be unneeded here, going to share t anyway. If you are freezing at all or this is your first big winter, take this moment while it's still nice to go to a thrift store. The target are wool clothes. Cotton is hell in the winter so finding a tight fitting merino wool sweater will give you a base layer for your chest and arms. Above that a oversized wool knit sweater will be plenty good for most stuff on campus with the cold. A jacket is still suggested when it's extra cold. 

Cashmere is what you want for being in the dorm. Cheap at thrift stores but it's like wearing a warm cloud. Super soft and plenty warm. Oversized ones will keep you comfy but tighter ones will make you feel that much more secure. 

Lambs wool sweaters are pretty thick and will do what you need in a sweater. 

Just don't over layer. You need at most there top layers and two bottom layers. Long underwear is a thing you can get and it works wonders. But too many layers will just make you frozen.

A couple heating options to help stay warm as well is a heating pad under your blanket. If you don't have one already then you need to. They help with cramps which is amazing but lower back pain goes away with them too. Wonderful tools. But with it under the blanket, it heats the entire area and turns it into a oven kind of.

Also it's worth noting that a big reason the mask mandate has stayed around this long is the fact that many professors have unvaccinated children, but the vaccine rollout for children under 12 is right around the corner. Do with that what you will.

Now for the political BS

COVID is never going away. At least not with anything resembling our current technology. However, if nearly everyone is vaccinated, there would be no need for masks or social distancing. With vax levels above 80% nationwide, and a better understanding of COVID and how to treat it, it would likely look like the flu, maybe a few thousand deaths a year. Maybe we'll have to get a new shot every year or 6 months or whatever that's fine, but there's no reason to stay masked forever. Staying masked won't prevent many deaths or cases, and even if it did we never did that for flu season, and nothing has materially changed since before the pandemic, there's no reason to suddenly change our morals when it comes to public health.

But this isn't about morals or public health for some people. This is about a sense of security. You can't see if someone is vaccinated, but you can definitely see if they're wearing a mask, and thus Taking COVID Seriously^(TM). 

None of that matters though, because again, the university will likely ditch their mandate the second the CDC does, and the likelihood there will be a new mandate deceases as vaccination rates increase.",0.0514,0.3893,0.5593

14408,"“So I began the transfer process in the middle of my second year of college, so I actually sent everything over mid-January 2020 and then I got a response back on March 11th. So my college GPA was about a 3.6 and I was well under the maximum amount of transferable credits (make sure you look this up, especially if you’re past your second year) and had AP credits from high school pass through as well. My high school GPA was also around a 3.6-3.8. Like another person on here, I also had no college level math classes (the ones at my old uni were on the blacklist and the very class I had dropped had a class average of 36% at the end). I also never had anything from placement tests or high school classes, so nothing weird there. So… yeah, don’t freak out when they say you need a math class. 

I will also clarify that on March 11th I was technically not accepted, I was told that I was basically on a list. If this happens to you, don’t freak out, just keep your grades up and you’ll be fine. They do this with a lot of transfers to make sure they don’t get accepted in the middle of the year and then have their grades tank for whatever reason. I had to resend my GPA with my spring (winter, at my old university) semester classes which I sent in immediately after my final grades came in on April 30th and got formally accepted on May 4th.

Both end up coming from students over time.  They chose to do the fees and raise the money that way because it could be 5-20 years before the general funds from the University would be good enough to invest into it.

This actually happened to me too. I was taking a political science class and would study by myself in a commons area before class. One of my classmates noticed me and commented about how I was leading the class and was always a vocal contributor. He asked to study with me and it became a thing for a few weeks where we'd meet up there and study. His grades went up quite a lot and word spread through the class that we were studying together. The next thing I know, I've got 15 people showing up as a group and they want me to lead a study session. I felt put out, but I led several of these figuring that vocalizing the material would help me too and maybe I'd make some friends with similar interests. I was always extremely thorough in going over all the material and was basically teaching a condensed version of our actual class.

Eventually I caught on that none of these people were even reading the material beforehand and several of them would show up without their homework done just to copy what I was discussing. Others were literally Googling the answers or had a Sparknotes level of understanding at best.

My professor was known for being tough and it wasn't abnormal for a large portion of the class to drop. They commented about how the class grades were booming and the retention rate during the semester was surprising. Everyone was doing their homework and scoring well on the tests which were essay only.

The guy who wanted to study with me initially told me at the end of the class that he didn't read a single thing the entire semester and figured he would definitely fail. He also thought our professor didn't like him and that it just had to come down to a personality conflict. He credited his success to my in-depth explanations and would write out his essay answers about as word for word as he could remember me explaining them. This guy also ended up passing the class with a higher grade than me if that's not an extra slap in the face. I got marked down for ""body language"" because I was regularly slouching in my chair and it cost me enough points that I lost the top grade.

The words Human and Mankind, derive from the Latin word humanus, which is gender neutral and means ""people of earth"".
It's a mix of the words Humus (meaning earth) and Homo (gender neutral, meaning Human or People).
Thus words like Fireman, Policeman, Human, Mankind, etc are not sexist in of it self.
The only sexism you will find here is the one you yourself look upon the world with.

Some people learn best through auditory means (listening to lectures).  Some people learn best by reading.  Some learn best through practum (practicing skills, or repeating what you just read/listened to to others).  There isn't one way to learn that will help everybody.

Have you been keeping up with the homework and reading assignments.  Have you been doing those in a location where you don't have other distractions?  Have you been attending lectures, digesting the info, and asking questions in class if you don't understand anything?  Biggest thing I can recommend is cut the distractions while trying to work through the class materis.  Shutting down the messaging apps, facebook, reddit, instagram and everything else ***is hard*** \-- I get that.  Those apps are designed to take and keep your attention.  I really hate the trend where all the material is on the computer/tablet because it takes a really strong person to not get distracted by all the flashing and noisy apps sitting right at your nose.  When you multi-task (or get distracted) by using those apps -- even for a quick peek to see if somebody posted a new instagram photo, you lose 15 minutes of concentration, taking you out of 'the zone'.  

And don't worry about talking to your professors.  As I've mentioned before, we are all human, and at least 95% of us are not evil.  Walking up to them and just asking how to get a better grade probably won't win any friends, but asking them what they would study for their exam might allow you to get more things to consider.",0.1147,0.3716,0.5137

You should meet with your prof(s) and ask what level of performance is required to get the grade you need based on the grading rubric; e.g., need an 90% on the midterm and a 80% on the final and 70% for the homework average. Having clear cut goals should help u focus on what needs to be done. You can also ask if there is any way to get bonus points by doing a presentation or something, but don't hang your hat on that as it's probably highly unlikely. 

How to learn? Have you been doing your homeworks? And I mean REALLY doing them, not just looking up answers on chegg and submitting rewritten work of others. Assuming you've been doing the hws (because if you haven't you should already know what the problem is) and it's only exams that are the problem you can request extra practice problems from the prof. You can look online for exams from previous semesters and even if they're from different profs they probably cover the same material.

You don’t need any previous experience doing model UN before joining (I certainly did not). The club does a great job teaching new people everything they need to know in a relaxed setting. 

  
Being in a committee is a good way to get to know a group of people really well &amp; the club also has larger events where everybody can get to know each other. 

  
Most of your time is working with your ""committee"" during weekly meetings. Each has a leader, or chair, and covers a specific topic that delegates will debate. I would recommend checking out the website (www.msumun.org) to see which ones interest you. 

  
The committees ""run"" during the MSUMUN conference. Highschool students participate in your committee as delegates and debate the issues that your committee covers. Its rewarding to see your hard work come to light, and the conference itself is a very fast paced and exciting weekend. 

  
To join email c.o.staff@msumun.org. Every interested person is welcomed. The application takes 10 minutes. It asks you to rank your preferred committees and asks some basic get to know you questions. The background check is required only as a liability because the conference is for high schoolers (minors). 

  
If you’re interested in joining a club with opportunities for leadership, this is a good place for you. With a year of experience, you can ""chair"" your own committee with a topic of your choosing. You can also apply to be on Secretariat, the conference executive board.",0.9303,0.0651,0.0046

Longer example:

He also said that man, the dudes who made the internet and basically every major milestone in CS (open-source bois, bell labs, and others) were idiots for not patenting their product.

Because money is obviously way better than the progress that we achieved as a result.

For a counter example, consider that Volvo created the tri-point seatbelt design (what every modern car has minus racing designs) and released it to public domain (no royalty payments). This has been widely credited with a HUGE, I'm talking MILLIONS of lives saved, reduction in fatalities.

They didn't receive a cent for it, but had they patented, it's likely it may have taken years if not decades more to adopt it in a meaningful way, if it did at all.

Progress for humanity is always better than a sole desire for profits. I'm not saying you shouldn't profit from your work, but it should come second to the betterment of your field. That is True professionalism.

Honors college status also lets you waive most prerequisites, except for things like needing calc 1 to take calc 2, etc. So you get a lot more freedom in class choice. You also get early course registration, as well as potential scholarships (a major plus, especially if you’re out of state). The only requirements to stay in honors are a 3.2 GPA over your time here, and the completion of 8 honors experiences, which can be anything from an honors section of a course to an extra presentation in a class. If you pick them right, it’s a small amount of extra work to gain all of the benefits I’ve described. I highly recommend the MSUHC.",0.9266,0.0694,0.0039

Between MSU and MTU, it really comes down to big school v small school.  I was really impressed with MTU's programs when we were up there, but most lists rank MSU's engineering higher.  And the facilities felt older at MTU.  It's 40,000 students where you'll meet all kinds of people or 8,000 students where you'll meet mostly engineering students.  I will say, MTU's class size is smaller...meaning you can't hide, but also meaning you're more likely to get singled out (both for needing help and for being brilliant).

Are you 100% that you want to be a CS major?  At State, you can switch to a wealth of other majors...  And Tech, everything but Engineering seems like an afterthought (but they are trying to develop other majors).

I get a report every morning of every instructional modality change that was made the day before.  Thoughout the entire month of October, here are the changes that have been made thus far:

7 sections shifted from hybrid to in-person

15 sections shifted from in-person to hybrid

1 section shifted from online to hybrid

7 sections shifted from online to in-person

56 sections shifted from in-person to online

So, excluding hybrid classes, there's been a net change of 49 sections from in-person to online.  With 6,583 sections being offered in the spring, that's a net change of 0.85%.  Those changes are pretty evenly spread across all the colleges.

For the spring,  right now 83% of the sections being offered are in-person, 9% are online, and 8% are hybrid.  For comparison, this fall those rates are 66% in-person, 19% online, and 14% hybrid.

For the spring, right now 73.5% of the seats being offered are in-person, 17.25% are online, and 9.25% are hybrid.  For comparison, this fall those rates are 48% in-person, 35% online, and 17% hybrid.

14977,"I am an MSU alum, grad of the CSE program in '87, inventor of 36 patents, some on essential technology for the cell phone in your pocket.. I was on numerous patent committees for a Fortune 50 company where we culled patents for pursue.  A few of things:  
1) Software only patents are now almost nearly impossible to get.. so his comments are no longer valid.

2) The folks who invented  TCP/IP and created Berkeley UNIX, did it as part of their master thesis. As such their concepts were owned by the University of California and their Regents. Given that this is a public entity, not sure they could do anything, since their work was funded and thus owned by the University. For what it's worth, that period where a university education was free in California happened about the same as the creation of Berkeley UNIX, the semiconductor industry, and the creation of TCP/IP.. I don't think this was a happy accident. Contrary to Fox News, Al Gore did not say he created the internet, but he sure did help getting the votes to fund the research for its creation.  


3) that all being said.. patents are important. As an engineer/technologist, you need to get paid for your creativity and novelty. In my line of work, we would never go after a company with our patent portfolio, unless we were threatened first. Patents are defensive business weapons, not offensive ones. Patent litigation is bad for business, because it can make your customers really angry with you. They have to navigate around all the legal shenanigans. Judges don't really understand technology, and they get it wrong about 50% of the time, and it can create a legal shitshow of epic proportions.

15072,"Thank you for the reply. This is constructive—I can work with that.

So, the fact that we're talking about it at all means it was effective. 

This picture has been shared several times in several different posts on this sub. We should step back for a moment, remove our own privilege from the reaction, and really think about why people are upset—it's probably because it hit them a little close to home. That's the thing about privilege, you aren't aware of it until you are—cognitive dissonance usually follows. Sometimes a little discomfort is good for drawing attention to a cause.

The notion that this ""divides"" students is pure rhetoric. The efforts of ""unifying"" people, in the context inferred by OP, are right out of the modern Republican Party concern troll playbook and wildly transparent. Get enough people upset, people get afraid, and stop seeking change.

If anything, we, as a community should share in this conversation and talk about the issue of institutional discrimination in health care, but that's strangely absent from these threads. It's easy enough to find citable references to move this forward and create equitable change for the underserved in our community so protest action like this isn't necessary.

Due to the number of fresh faces I'm seeing on the sub today, I'm imagining that a lot of the vitriol is coming from agent provocateurs and not actual members of the MSU community. Watching the up/downvotes on my comments tells me that a lot of people are brigading the sub.

It is privilege that lets people complain about the message while missing all of the words. Do I, for a second, really believe that any real proponents of progressive and equitable change in health care are complaining about this? No.

To casually call the effort racist or offer semantic substitution games in lieu of actually talking about what the student was attempting to do is pointless and rooted in logical fallacy. This seems to plague a lot of discourse online and hurts real progressive causes. People become afraid of how they'll be seen, or worry about losing social credit, so they say nothing. Institutional discrimination continues. 

Looking at her poster, I didn't feel offended, nor did I feel like I was being targeted. Maybe some people did, but that's something they have to square with themselves and really unpack why.

Was this student's experiment a bad take? It's not for me to say. To have that opinion would be a product of my own unconscious privilege.

So many people can't grasp the distinction between systemic or institutional racism versus individual racism. Do I like it when an idiot uses the n word? No, I think it is bad. Is it racist to have a booth charging white people for masks but letting ""minorities"" have them for free? Debatable, but let's say yes. But in both cases, I don't really care about the individual case. The bigger issue, at least in this country (and pretty much every other once-colonized country) is systemic and institutional racism. 

The ""reverse racism"" and jokes about ""haven't you heard, black people can't be racist"" are just intentionally obtuse. Of course black people can be individually racist, like everyone else. But because they haven't been literally every president, almost every supreme court justice, the vast majority of governors, police officers, CEOs, lawmakers,
even the majority of stockholders, property owners, supervisors, etc., I don't really care. It isn't a threat to me or my existence as a white guy. If there's an individual is racist (black, white, whatever), I write them off as an asshole and don't waste any more time.

15573,"Do we know that she is on the political left, or is that an assumption because she's not a white man?  


This form of ""protest"" is called the ""affirmative action bake sale"" (although this is Covid-themed rather than cookies). It is almost always done by conservative student groups to protest real or imagined ""affirmative action.""  Occasionally, it has been used by those on the other side to highlight pay differences. For example, putting a sign that says $0.80 for women and $1.00 for men because white women make 80% of what white men do.   


There are quite a lot of black people who oppose affirmative action because they fear backlash and the assumption that they were admitted to a university or given a job just because of their race and thus are unqualified and shouldn't be there. So it is not a given that she is ""on the political left"". Most black people vote Democratic for historical reasons (Democrats supported the Civil Rights Act, Republicans supported racial segregation after national Democrats rejected the Southern Democrats). However, most black people are pretty conservative, especially because they are usually more religious than white people. (""Conservative"" in the traditionalist, family-oriented, individualist, Christian, etc. sense rather than the hysterical conspiracy theorists who now dominate ""conservative"" punditry.) Since this is a very common activity of conservative student groups, it seems a leap to assume she's not conservative.  


Performance protests have the problem of failing to convey their message. For example, some of the performances by Extinction Rebellion don't convey ""stop polluting"", they just are weird. Conservatives tried running around naked in diapers on school campuses. This also failed to convey their message and just made them a subject of mockery themselves. It is ambiguous what her message is, which makes it a failed protest. Sometimes it's better just to carry a sign and chant.",0.0388,0.36,0.6012

Usually it’s supposed to go fast, I don’t know what kind of line I was standing in but for some reason it would not move at all while other parts of the student section entrance were going so fast.

This is to keep them from drying out and very nice and new looking, if you like to look of boots that have been lived in (as I do for certain occasions) then you can skip care for them once in a while and let some wear happen to the leather but don't skip for a long duration. To keep them nice and clean you really should just lightly wipe them down with a dry rag every night to remove salt deposits and water spots. I would use the dry cleaning kit once a week, the cleanser once every two weeks, wax them once a month, and water proof them 3 days after you wax them each time. When dry cleaning it's okay to leave the laces in, take laces out when using the cleanser and when waxing the boots but leave laces in when using the waterproofing spray. A little bit goes a very long way for all of these products, the whole package should last 2-3 years on that regiment.",0.461,0.5057,0.0333

15750,"Also just a tip for clothing, wool is your friend. Over dressing is pretty bad as well. Layers upon layers can often make things colder so at most a totally of 3 layers on the top and 2 on the bottom. [Merino wool base layers](https://www.moosejaw.com/product/icebreaker-men-s-200-zone-seamless-legging_10497784)  are recommended as when cotton gets wet, it sucks the warmth from your body.   


A good trick I like to do for a merino wool base layer top is to go to the thrift store and get a few merino wool long sleeve tops which are a little small on me. That way instead of paying $50 for a top, I'm paying around $5. They also have lambs wool sweaters, wool knit sweaters, and cashmere sweaters which is a type of wool that makes you feel like you're wearing a warm cloud. All of which is at most any thrift store.  


Long wool socks help as well but if you do get a insulated boot, your feet might sweat if your feet are too warm.  


A good jacket makes the world of difference. Insulated jackets will keep the warmth in but windproof jackets will keep the wind out which is a big factor of the cold you'll feel. If you've got the money, [there are](https://www.moosejaw.com/product/outdoor-research-men-s-helium-down-hooded-jacket_10493627) some [good options](https://www.moosejaw.com/product/eddie-bauer-first-ascent-men-s-downlight-hooded-jacket_10490087) out there that do it all.

This is especially dangerous being that you probably don't know how to adjust your gate and stride for walking in snow and ice and a low-traction boot sole will only amplify your mistakes. I'll also say I wouldn't be caught dead wearing those boots, that utilitarianism look has long been dead and gone despite the attempt by many to revive the style.

&amp;#x200B;

Now it's important to note some things before you pick a boot.. Firstly, how hot do you expect the classrooms you will be in to be and will you be able to maintain comfort in that setting with your feet stuffed into perfectly insulated boots in which your bodyheat will lead them to feel like small saunas stuck on your feet. If you typically handle heat rather well then you could probably go for an insulated boot. If you think you might not be able to stand that or you're concerned about the possibility of the liner soaking up foot smell (they do this rather well for just about every insulated pair of boots, it's why people used to go through two to three pairs of UGG boots a year) you should probably opt for a non-insulated boot. And finally, your boot material depends on the level at which you're ready to suffer in the beginning. If you want a stylish and extremely comfortable pair of boots after a long term of usage pick up some leather boots, but if you'd rather avoid the blisters and discomfort around your feet and ankles whilst breaking them in you should opt for a pair that doesn't require a lengthy break-in period. Think of something made of some kind of fabric like nylon or polyester. As I've found it really depends on the thickness of the leather but on average a well taken care of pair of boots will take you anywhere from 100 to 150 hours of usage in constant motion for them to contour to your foots shape and movement. After that break-in period they will fit like a glove and you will love them to death.",0.1659,0.5478,0.2863

We went out last night to the bars while some degenerates decided it would be funny to flip and beat my car because it had a block ‘M’ bumper sticker on it. You guys won the damn game and this is how you act? Shame on you and shame on your university for enabling this behavior. What makes me even more sick to my stomach is that this is my grandma’s car and it has a handicap license plate. So these assholes willingly totaled a car that belonged to a handicapped person. This happened on Milford Street at around 10 pm last night. My parents and I filed a police report, and the police are going to run facial recognition tests on the videos I currently have of the incident. If anyone has any other videos/information about the perpetrators could you please DM me? I would greatly appreciate it.

This seems like the trend to me, it's usually like 25%-50% MSU students of those arrested. It's troubling that students are involved at all, but when you have a significant number of people coming to the campus specifically because they want to cause mischief like this, it's a recipe for disaster.

My initial thought is that the students need to organize and actually band together and make sure this shit stops. I'm not sure trying to physically stop the mayhem is the answer, cause a drunk kid willing to flip a car is probably also willing to throw a few sucker punches. But a lot of the arrests in previous years have come from students helping to identify those involved through recordings like this one; the majority of MSU students who don't want this reputation need to make it known that if you partake in this, you will be identified and you will be arrested.",0.0187,0.2244,0.757

That was the first thing I found on a quick google. 9/23 arrested were students, the rest were not. I feel like that's usually the typical range for most of these incidents; maybe 25-40% students and the rest from off campus. 

Obviously the fact that any students are involved is troubling, and I think most of us wish that it just didn't happen period. The problem is that there is that reputation now, to the point that people who are looking to cause trouble are coming around specifically for that purpose.

I don't know what the solution is. Somehow Detroit managed to put and end to Devil's night, so there's gotta be something the university can do.

Cameras are not expensive, wireless cameras can be set up and hooked up to the wifi that it already everywhere for under a hundred dollars per unit. The university takes in millions every year, they could light this places up and protect every bike rack around campus for a fraction of what they take it every year.

The FDA just approved Pfizer vaccine for children.  Don’t you think there is some value in promoting this not as just a protection for children, but more so as a preventative measure so they don’t spread the virus to those 60 and over?

Because statistically the virus will not harm 99.99999% of children.  The value prop of a children’s vaccine is so they don’t spread it.  This is important from a messaging standpoint to the US public.  

Mark my words, the Feds will say it’s about “protecting the children”, this will get compared to millions of Americans personal experience that the virus was a little sniffle for their kids, so the end result will be kids won’t get the vaccine.

17298,"I think you’re absolutely right, investigators definitely know a lot more details than we do and they probably will not tell us all of them. I’m very curious about who he was hanging out with as well.

Here is my theory: he was with friends at Yakeley and his car was parked at Brody. He needed to get something so he decided to take the half mile walk by himself. Yakeley is a women’s dorm, maybe that has something to do with why he decided to go alone. Somehow on the trek he ended up in the river. As you mentioned, the river crossed the path twice, so there’s two opportunities where it could have happened. Since the cops are focusing on the ball field area, I bet they have GPS or CCTV of him up until that point. Although I agree, it seems like someone would be around since it was before game day, Grand River and North of it is far more busy than campus itself was during this time. It’s totally possible for no one to have been around. As for how he ended up in the river, someone could have pushed him in, or he could have been drunk and fell over the side of the bridge while trying to throw up, or some other tragic accident. It’s horrifying to imagine.

I’ve been doing some research and there have been 3 other cases similar to this since 1990, where a young man is hanging out with friends, probably drinking, then goes missing on or near campus and is found in the Red Cedar. All of them were deemed accidents, some people say they’re connected and foul play was involved, but it seems unlikely. The reason why this phenomenon happens so often is because college kids don’t make the best decisions, they often drink too much, and rivers are dangerous. It’s extremely tragic.

17305,"My suspicion is that the investigators know a lot more than they'll ever reveal to the general public. I'm sure they want to wait until everything is resolved, but there's obviously a lot more to the story we don't know. I take that route quite a bit throughout my week, and if he was heading from Yaekely to Brody, that path would cross the river at least twice, not to mention the bends and drop offs in the wooded areas.

I know at night that curve by the ballfield is nearly completely unlit, however I suspect there would have been others around considering it was right before midnight. I'm not sure how populated campus was the night before the game.

What bothers me most is that we don't know any details about who he was visiting. He wasn't an MSU student, so why would he be walking alone from one hall to another? It just seems to me that at that time on such a big night, he'd be with at least one of his friends, or at least a group he'd be in close contact with. That's just why I'm thinking he could have left his group to meet someone and never came back.

I'm not trying to theorize too heavily on this distressing situation, but I like everyone else want him to be found safely. I just wonder who he was visiting that night, how under the influence he could have been, or where he would have ended up within that timeframe.

Edit: I’m not sure if it was ever specified if he was heading back to his car at Brody or where his friends were staying. That would kind of void out my ‘he went to meet someone else’ theory. 

I’m also realizing that he went missing Friday night, so it wasn’t as busy on campus as it was after the victory, making it less likely for anyone to have seen him.

Hopefully we hear more soon and he’s found safe.",0.05,0.4689,0.4811

Failing could also lower your gpa preventing you from being admitted to a degree program. 

If you fail a lot of classes you can get academic prohibition, your GPA has to fall pretty low for that, and you get like a semester to get it back up above water.

I don’t know what other comments you’re referring to but what data actually gets deleted is up to the country/state you live-in’s laws, where the company operates out of, and how they want to process the request. 

Some companies will do a complete wipe of anything ever related to your account, others just toss personal stuff like payment into, name, address but keep anything about related like login info, usernames, etc… because in many cases like with many online games those credentials are literally owned by the company in order to prevent lawsuits from being banned and stuff.

You won’t know how to program legacy systems either coming out of school, regardless of whether you know Java.  It’s a matter of what kind of Dev work you want to do.  I spent 20 years at IBM and Cisco and lots of people spend their careers doing backbone and enterprise systems like you have worked on at AWS, which is great.  But you could argue that at this point, those global behemoths are niche, compared to the thousands of born-in-the-cloud apps.  

To each their own, and you really can’t go wrong with either but picking Java - and by extension, the legacy/backbone/middleware/GUI path it will take you on - is like being 20 and buying savings bonds or combustion engine vehicle.

Just because you know python doesn't mean you can suddenly do machine learning. Someone who has done machine learning in MatLab and has never touched another language in their life will have an easier time doing machine learning in python than someone who is a master at python, but hasn't done machine learning before. Languages are easy to learn. Skills are hard.

 If you are working in machine learning, you use python, because it's better for machine learning. If you are building android apps, you use Java or Kotlin, because they are better for that purpose. If you are working in enterprise, Java is just as good as any other language, and is way easier than switching all of the existing code to another language, or integrating the two services together. If you are doing Operating Systems work, you use C or assembly, because that's the best tool for the job (though rust is a great replacement). 

I worked for Amazon for 3 years, for 3 different teams in 2 different spaces. Everything was Java, because it's a great language to build scalable code in. 2/3 teams build entirely on native AWS, but still used Java because it's a great language for building backend applications. TypeScript was more commonly used than python internally, because it's better than python for most use cases. 

Any dev with the slightest amount of competency can code in whatever C-like language they need to. Java is still the most used language and it's stupid to dismiss it because it's not as good for niche use cases.

18085,"Hey GenderNeutralBot, listen up.

The words Human and Mankind, derive from the Latin word humanus, which is gender neutral and means ""people of earth"".
It's a mix of the words Humus (meaning earth) and Homo (gender neutral, meaning Human or People).
Thus words like Fireman, Policeman, Human, Mankind, etc are not sexist in of it self.
The only sexism you will find here is the one you yourself look upon the world with.

18463,"Well written.
But. Housing was never a given past one year. They have always said if space is available. Even small schools rarely have enough housing for all students. A event could take out a dorm or two and make plans change. Also housing has stated living in the area won’t be an automatic exemption, so if someone has parents that buy a place tit is not automatic. I saw housing answered that. There are plenty of cheap off campus housing available. Yeah you can sign at one of the new flashy places or you can sign a bit further out. I’m guessing students with disabilities are not affected. They are holding back rooms specifically that are accessible and they were not able to be picked up during housing sign up. I even saw a statement that they keep some open in case someone needs to stay temporarily. I have no idea how often that happens, but I was surprised to see that. 3rd and 4th year students walk leave school all the time due to many different reasons. I could go on about the rest of the reasons you stated but I’m not. Housing isn’t going to change their mind on this. It’s not a money grab. Campus is full either way. Just like when people say withdraw your kid to hurt MSU.. they have a waiting list a mile long and they will just fill your spot either way. There is no reason to sign a lease now for any off campus place. They will all have room in august. Sublease a place and get the other person to kick in cash..then you get your place for cheaper.

I don't want this to come across as angry towards you personally, and I wish nothing but the best and a quick recovery for you, OP, really. Just wanted to point something out as far as this notion that everyone on campus/ MSU area is vaccinated, because (&amp; I'm sorry for being possibly just seeming trollish or disagreeable here), but, they're not. 

 The fact is that  not everyone that's on campus today, a month ago, or a month from now, etc, is fully safe or fully vaccinated from COVID-19 -- and, some folks are vaccinated but still get breakthrough cases. 

 It's rare, but it does happen, no I've seen it with multiple people, and they were older folk, but they were fully vaccinated and wore masks , totally tried to stay safe whenever and however they could, all it took was a friend showing up at their door, ONCE, the friend is one of those anti-vaccination / anti-mask ppl (not just someone who complains that ""masks suck,"" cuz I mean, most ppl think masks suck, I just mean to say that this particular person is over of those ""COVID is a liberal hoax, Qanon is real, blah blah""- types)). 

So , she didn't have her mask on, and she in the past months adamantly refused any vaccines, masks, distancing, staying safe or whatever, no reason other than lazy stubbornness, no immunocompromised issues, nothing like that, but she'd go out whenever, getting and giving ppl COVID, she didn't take any weird sketchy alternative medicines instead or ""supplement with zinc and vitamin c"", she just didn't care, at all, and they assumed it was VERY likely she was the giver of corona on this case, though technically no they can't prove it, but.... Sometimes, you get more than just a hint, you know?...
That's one of the reasons ppl still need to wear masks, not everyone is vac'd, and those who are against it, SOME of them (not all - but SOME) of them are brazen about lying/ getting fake vaccination cards, (seems easier to just get the shot but I won't get into that one right now) but ppl openly talk about how they think it's so easy too get a 'fake id' for COVID-19, ( I've seen posts on different college sub reddits for WVSU , or Ann arbor, Detroit, even around here too a bit, talking about forging those vax cards, I'm sure it could be done, but.....eew )

 Also, please conside this::  not everyone who is in EL this week or month is going to /Working at MSU , some are fans here to see the game, some are passing through, some are here whatever their reason, friends, family, etc, they're not all vac'd...

Off campus housing is cheaper. You can rent a room or studio apartment for cheaper than campus. If it’s a scholarship issue then you need to talk to financial aid to see if it can be converted for off campus. I’ve heard they will do that and cut you a check. I’m just saying a letter covering a broad range of issues may not be the best approach. If you think you need to live on campus then I would approach them about yourself. That means go in person. Be prepared to have proof and be able to articulate nicely to them. Plan on making more than one trip there. But the biggest thing is that you were never given proof in writing that housing on campus for all of your years at MSU was a given. I’m just not sure why people are upset over something that wasn’t guaranteed or in a contract. Be prepared to be disappointed. The trend for MSU is to accept more students every fall- at some point this would squeeze out more older students on campus. They could decide to redo a dorm which would eliminate space. They implemented the live on for two years requirement December 1st 2020. On campus housing can accommodate 18,203. They estimate 16,000 students will be required to live on campus next year that are freshman and sophomore. That only leaves 2200 spots across campus for older students, which isn’t many. MSU can house almost half their undergrad enrollment which is far more than most other schools. Most other schools house barely a quarter of their undergrads.",0.0637,0.4716,0.4647

Huge tip: if you don't want to go through another whole annoying process of applying to the college of business for finance, I suggest trying to apply to RBC (Residential Business Community. I think this may be for freshmen only though). It's a program that entails some extra things you would need to attend and (i think) maybe taking an extra course/credit, but a great benefit is if you get into that program/community, you get into the college of business instantly. 

When picking classes, check [msugrades.com](https://msugrades.com), search up the course you have in your schedule (or the course you're trying to add/change), and then you can see how people overall do in that class. You can also click on a certain professor for that class to see which one is easiest for the course. Asking here on this subreddit about certain courses/professors will hopefully most likely get you a review/response as well.

19064,"Hi! There is a team of us on Facebook that have been working through theories. These are not verified facts, just bread crumbs we’ve created a plausible timeline around. Here is the big question based around this THEORY. Who saw Brendan after 1am?

Yes we understand the river is the most plausible scenario. We’re not entertaining it on this thread. Please don’t clog it with falling into the river scenerios.

He wasn’t physically seen (by anyone who knew him) leaving Yakely Hall. But we know his phone pinged by Mich Ave and Beal St. somewhere around midnight.

Random comment on a post. Dude says daughter sees him go UP with a bunch of guys on an elevator around 12:30 at Landmark Apartments. She mentions the 13th floor, their isn’t a 13th floor. For this scenario, We’ll just say she saw him in the Landmark elevator going up.

Yakely hall is only a 6 minute walk from the Landmark. It’s possible he could’ve received a message off snap chat or some other social media app before his phone died, mapped it out real quick, and set off on foot. The apartments are on top of a Target store. There should be cameras both inside/outside the building, and definitely inside these elevators that could verify this.

Now, another comment was made that someone mentioned she saw him get into a white car around 1am on S Harrison by the bus top at the front of the Kellog Center.

Hypothetically, If we were to play this out, I think he left Yakely hall heading towards Brody around 11:45pm-12am. Plan WAS to head back to Brody but he gets disoriented, messages that’s he’s lost. We can assume he was probably messaging more than one person. Insert random friends message *** “Omg your lost? Come through” WALKS to Landmark Apartments, probably gets there around 12:10-12:15 and finds his “friends”. Which is where dudes daughter sees him going up to a floor that doesn’t exist. Somewhere around 12:30? “Friends” instead of having someone take him back, they aren’t ready to leave yet. He gets directions on how to get back from them. Leaves Landmark on foot. It’s a 15-20 minute walk from the Landmark to Brody Hall, the and the Kellog Center is right across from Brody Hall.  I think he left early and his “friends” in the white car saw him walking and picked him up on their way through. “Bro it’s raining, where is your coat? Hop in” Brendan hops in, around 1am in front of the Kellog Center.

PS: bikes are supposed to follow traffic rules not pedestrian rules. Their ""go"" lights is the traffic signal, not the crosswalk signal. And they should be riding the same way as traffic.

19175,"Hi! There is a team of us on Facebook that have been working through theories. These are not verified facts, just bread crumbs we’ve created a plausible timeline around. Here is the big question based around this THEORY. Who saw Brendan after 1am?

Yes we understand the river is the most plausible scenario. We’re not entertaining it on this thread. Please don’t clog it with falling into the river scenerios.

He wasn’t physically seen (by anyone who knew him) leaving Yakely Hall. But we know his phone pinged by Mich Ave and Beal St. somewhere around midnight.

Random comment on a post. Dude says daughter sees him go UP with a bunch of guys on an elevator around 12:30 at Landmark Apartments. She mentions the 13th floor, their isn’t a 13th floor. For this scenario, We’ll just say she saw him in the Landmark elevator going up.

Yakely hall is only a 6 minute walk from the Landmark. It’s possible he could’ve received a message off snap chat or some other social media app before his phone died, mapped it out real quick, and set off on foot. The apartments are on top of a Target store. There should be cameras both inside/outside the building, and definitely inside these elevators that could verify this.

Now, another comment was made that someone mentioned she saw him get into a white car around 1am on S Harrison by the bus top at the front of the Kellog Center.

Hypothetically, If we were to play this out, I think he left Yakely hall heading towards Brody around 11:45pm-12am. Plan WAS to head back to Brody but he gets disoriented, messages that’s he’s lost. We can assume he was probably messaging more than one person. Insert random friends message *** “Omg your lost? Come through” WALKS to Landmark Apartments, probably gets there around 12:10-12:15 and finds his “friends”. Which is where dudes daughter sees him going up to a floor that doesn’t exist. Somewhere around 12:30? “Friends” instead of having someone take him back, they aren’t ready to leave yet. He gets directions on how to get back from them. Leaves Landmark on foot. It’s a 15-20 minute walk from the Landmark to Brody Hall, the and the Kellog Center is right across from Brody Hall.  I think he left early and his “friends” in the white car saw him walking and picked him up on their way through. “Bro it’s raining, where is your coat? Hop in” Brendan hops in, around 1am in front of the Kellog Center.

If you have an interest and we have a club for it I would try to do that, otherwise, you're probably going to be very lonely. COVID tracing does not exist here. Professors are not happy. MSU claims they have no money, but apparently we have a brand new multi-thousand dollar bus that we didn't need. Nobody works in the cafeteria at a liveable wage. If you apply to a job, you will most likely have to work for 7 dollars if you get the job at all. CATA buses (main on-campus transportation) either don't come at all or come super late as of recent.

The people I met when I visited Michigan state were great and the sentiment was “yeah you should go here, it’s awesome”. But I enjoyed every minute of it. The sports are great, the campus is beautiful, the academics are kind of what you make it, like I could’ve challenged myself more if I wanted to or I absolutely could’ve skated by but I think the main point is there’s something for darn near anyone as far as academics, clubs, social life, etc… east Lansing has exploded since I left so I imagine the town itself has more to offer than when I was there which is a lot. 

The only drawback I would say i experienced is that if you want a small classroom experience you may be disappointed by MSU’s pre req classes. Most of the big classes (and I mean 300+ in a classroom larger than most high school auditoriums) will have weekly meetings in smaller groups with a TA though. But all of my higher level math, stats, and Econ classes junior and senior year were smaller classes. The thing to remember, that admittedly I did poorly when I was there, is that you can always ask your professors and TA’s for extra help, and usually other students are happy to go back over stuff too. I just was always the smart kid who didn’t need help so I was poorly prepared for that.

The Alumni connection is real and I had quite a few business meetings I got just because I was an MSU Alumnus when I started my business.

There are quite a few gripes on this subreddit, but bear in mind survivorship bias- that is, the most sensationalized and irking stories make the front page because they garner the most attention. And most of all many times its the ones where people are shocked (i.e. they don't expect it)

That being said, there are some issues primarily with the food service and the beaurocracy / inner workings of MSU, but I don't think they're necessarily exclusive to MSU they're just more pronounced. Dorms can be iffy and especially with the 2 year rule its a bit sketchy, but I don't think it's anything that I think should be a deal breaker as they certainly are better than some hotels I've stayed in and some apartments I've lived in.

There's always something happening on campus too and there's a TON or friendly people you can meet and hang out with based on your interests, especially clubs (check out the discords). Most of the time you can just ask if anyone wants to play a game or hang out and you'll get at least a handful.

It’s mostly what you make of it, it’s so large there’s pretty much any kind of crowd you want. However, if you place high value on academics, I don’t feel like the professors are the best and I have never felt like MSU is super academically rigorous, but it is a Big Ten school so you do get lots of opportunities to get good internships and jobs. I would say you should make your choice on the basis of if you want access to reputable internships and jobs vs. if you want an enriching undergrad learning experience. Although, if public policy is your major I’m not super informed on it, but I hear that James Madison is a great experience.

19381,"First of all congratulations 🎉

Second if all MSU is a huge school and with that comes it's advantages and disadvantages.  From my experience if you can find a way to pare it down it helps considerably and gives you a smaller college experience with all of the opportunities of a larger university.  For example, I got my degree in Human Biology, but instead of joining the College of Natural Science I joined Lyman Briggs (a residential college).  By the end of my time in Briggs I knew almost all of the people in my graduating class and I got to experience the insanity that is game day during football season or IZONE or the absolutely gorgeous campus or the opportunities that come with well funded programs.  Something else to keep in mind would be MSU's study abroad program is ranked top 10 in nation and it's very well known as a great research university.  Bottom line I think whether you choose to accept or not will depend on your degree and what program you're looking into.  Personally as an alum I wouldn't trade my experience at State for the world and the 4 years I spent there resulted in many stories, lasting friendships, and a quality education. 

Regarding meals, I would say MSU does an amazing job.  There is always a wide variety of meals to choose from and they are very flexible regarding dietary needs.  They also have holiday and themed dinners that are always a hit.

I hope this helps! Best of luck with your decision!",0.8963,0.0924,0.0113

Safest? I mean....

19940,"The article doesn't mention Fentanyl or Cannabis, but I just wanna throw out more information about that jazz for those interested!

For those out there using drugs;

Links to purchasing test kits for various drugs and/or fentanyl testing strips:

Information on sending in a sample of drugs for lab testing in the US;

I wouldn't be too worried about cannabis being adulterated with fentanyl, considering that there aren't that many levels of separation between the grower and the consumer, in general. Furthermore, it isn't that cost effective. Trace contamination is possible if cannabis is stored with fentanyl at some point, but most likely rare and at too small a concentration to cause effects. ALSO: This is a swell thread to check out by Ryan Marino, a Cleveland Medical Toxicologist. It looks like the first reported case of fentanyl being found in cannabis in the US was in Connecticut and reported 13 hours ago, so idk if that's what you're referring to, but looks iffy. https://twitter.com/RyanMarino/status/1463018102338330630?t=EjcA8YoTVIA2pA5Ghtk4KA&amp;s=19

EDIT: Thread on same report by DanceSafe (a drug safety org): https://twitter.com/DanceSafe/status/1463007473543962629?t=5y57JT-1pJZkNaSpA6Vacw&amp;s=19

But, at the end of the day, GET NARCAN TRAINED, GET NARCAN. Michigan allows you to get narcan without a prescription. The Ingham County health department website has a map of where you can get it. https://hd.ingham.org/SeekingCare/SubstanceUse/Naloxone.aspx

Finally, you aren't at risk of overdosing on fentanyl unless you ingest, snort, or inject it. There is a LD50, as there are for all drugs (the amount it would take for a substance to be lethal for 50% of a population). All drugs lethality vary from person to person. Fentanyl is used safely in hospitals every day! For most information addressing fentanyl misinformation, check out this medical toxicologist address a few;

The student who passed away was a pledge who was celebrating their crossing. I'm assuming this frat carried with that tradition and the student blacked out and unfortunately did not wake up. The other passed-out pledges were taken to the hospital and I believe are recovering now.

But there is a police investigation now and the community that this frat and attending sororities are a part of will most likely be investigated or shut down since this community is tight-knit. You can look at this thread for the exact name of the frat and sororities.",0.0455,0.4726,0.482

I used a lot of the kitchen cabinets for misc stuff that wasn't really kitchen related. The bathroom is plenty spacious, the closet is a good size for one person, the furniture was easy to manage. The only thing with the M1 is the bed is a murphy bed so it pulls down from the wall, if you remove the couch cushions it slides right between the arms of the couch. I just put my cushions on the window-sill at night so they didn't sit on the ground. Plenty of space for activities and friends being over when the bed is put up too, couch can fit 2-3 people depending on size, the table for your TV can fit up to a 48 inch with side-legs or if you use a center-stand it can manage a 55 inch or bigger. I had a blast hosting game-day parties in my place, I did have an extra computer chair and beanbag for more seating for friends. I never heard one of them complain about the space being small, it's really just a nice cozy atmosphere.

\- In 1798, President John Adams signed a law that gave the government power to order quarantines in the wake of a yellow fever epidemic that left thousands dead across the country.  
\-In 1903, Massachusetts closed all schools, public libraries and churches to fight against smallpox.  
\-In 1904, Jacobson v. Massachusetts it was ruled that Cambridge, Massachusetts could require all adults to be vaccinated against smallpox.  
\-In 1904 the Supreme Court ruled against a Massachusetts pastor defending his right to choose not to be vaccinated in which he argued over the invasion of liberty to be fined or imprisoned for refusing to get vaccinated. The Supreme Court asserted the government’s right to impose compulsory vaccination laws to save lives, especially if children and adults can be saved from disease through vaccination.   
\-In 1917, smallpox vaccinations were a requirement in Arkansas for school attendance, and any court cases fighting against the law were dismissed.  
\-The Arkansas state legislature passed a law mandating vaccinations for polio, diphtheria, tetanus and measles in 1967 for all public and private students, with rubella added in 1973.

People like the above do not seem to grasp how hospitals work. How they are designed to operate on expected paitent loads, and that load is expected to keep tbe hospital at 99% capacity at all times to maximize revenue. An empty bed is a bed that isn't generating revenue. So just in time supply chain theory has been applied to hospital services so that ideally each time a patient is released a new patient is walking through the door. 


So what is the problem then? A pandemic disrupts that model, because hospitals are inelastic. They have no way to easily absorb increases in volume, especially long term increases in volume. Heroic measures, like nationalizing convention centers and deploying the Army Core of Engineers to construct temporary field hospitals are the only choice to absorb disasters. That works for a hurricane, earthquake, major terrorist attack, etc.


However, a epidemic flare up is almost worse. It's bad enough to overwhelm the hospital capacity, but not bad enough to call in the cavalry. So what happens? People are left in hallways, in wheelchairs. Then in waiting rooms, then told to stay in their cars. Then just not to bother coming in at all. 

What do those numbers look like? 

Greater Lansing has basically 2  hospitals for the entire city (with a new one on the way) which is over half a million people. Combined they have 880 beds between them. When the new hospital is completed, it will have 260 beds, but it is replacing the smaller hospital in the area, so the net beds will stay the same. 


880 beds for half a million people that are full 99% of the time NOT CONSIDERING COVID. That is why everyone that knows what is going on has their butthole tighten everytime there is a surge.

I ask myself... is it going to be the one? Will this surge coinside with some other event that will send an extra 100 People to the hospital? Because that starts a death spiral causing the hospital system to break down. And if you think the hospitals do not have this mapped out you're wrong. They have models, and costs, and insurance to cover the resulting litigation. But that doesn't help the people's lives that are lost for their profits, or for a bunch of hill billies precieved freedoms. 

And if you're ignorant and self deluded to think that it won't or can't happen, all it would take is a bad ice storm on 127 and 496 interchange at rush hour creating a big car accident, or worse some terrible accident during a sporting event on campus, or at a  Lansing Center event and there you have it.

20045,"After reading all the comments, I thought of a few things that might answer some questions asked. These are things I've heard both from the official FB page, News interview w/Police &amp; comments made early on by people that claim they know him.  Obviously, I can't verify the accuracy of the statements beyond referencing the sources. 
Several news reports indicate Divers are again searching the Red Cedar river since it's now 5 feet lower then it was. The current tends to be very fast, and debris plus the previous depth from rains made searching difficult. They also said they can only view 2 ft. They have used boats, Sonar &amp; Divers &amp; underwater drones. They also are using Search Dogs &amp; above ground drones. According to people familiar with the river conditions on Oct 29 &amp; now, they say there is a lot of overgrowth between the walkway &amp; river.  All say that it would be difficult to simply stumble &amp; ""fall in"". (I know there's an area w/easier access but the overgrown areas are closer to where his cell phone data places him)  The Investigators &amp; Water Search Teams are considering ""damming"" the river.  Because they don't know exactly where to search they would need to do it in 2 or 3 locations.  They say this is the perfect time to do it since the water level has dropped 5 feet. There are many concerns, including the banks &amp; having enough room for overflow.  They would need the State (whoever is in charge of River maintenance etc) to sign off.  They say damming the River would take about a day.  
 
Police have questioned his friends as they've needed. The friends he has at MSU are friends he knows well &amp; has known for a very long time. They have been very open &amp; helpful but are also (obviously) young &amp; very traumatized. 

Details about drinking etc were not given to the public, I understand, because they don't need to know that along w/other details.  They dis say that they don't believe he had any intention of harming himself, wasn't upset &amp; was a generally happy guy with a positive outlook.  He was looking forward to his first year at GVSU. Everyone who knows him say he always has a smile on his face, is warm &amp; outgoing and would do anything for anyone. Investigators have all the detailed info &amp; are in charge of what is being released to the public in order to ""protect integrity of investigation"".

 I've heard it said that while Brendan is known to drink occasionally, he always knows when he's had enough &amp; stops. It was also said that he was heading back to the dorm/car because he was done for the night. Some people speculated, based on other info, that he may have been ""tipsy"" but not black out drunk. Apparently he and a friend even exchanged car keys, which was assumed to be a way to keep them less likely to drink/drive. Friends at the dorm reported him missing the next day &amp; not sooner cuz they assumed he just slept in another dorm room.  Some of his friends assumed he slept in his friends car (the one he had the car keys to) but when they checked, he wasn't there. When they all realized their assumptions were wrong, they reported his disappearance to the campus police. 
He's a major athlete, 160lbs &amp; played Hockey, LaCross etc. which seems to go along w/him not tending to party late or drink excessively (an assumption some people have made).   

Re: The cameras outside the dorm not working.  The Univ has apologized &amp; immediatly did an investigation. There were ""chips"" in the camera that were on a ""banned country list"" so they had been removed &amp; not replaced.  The Univ immediatly ordered replacements for all cameras not working in addition to installing more. I belive they said they are installing 300 cameras. 

The Investigators continue to follow up on all tips &amp; sightings as well as continue searching.  There's a major movement to hang poster ALL over &amp; get his face &amp; story in as many places as possible.  

Donations were made for a Reward which is now over 20k.  There's also a ""go fundme"" site which has raised 110k last time I checked, ALL unsolicited. 

That's about all I can remember reading.  It would be great if people could post the flyer (I think its at the top of the comments) wherever they go!  While they may find clues or answers in the river, this is still an active ground search &amp; covers the USA.  Airports have been contacted &amp; flyers posted as well.

# Post-game disturbance, shot fired, missing student have campus on alert

Michigan State University has seen a rough two weeks, with several disturbing events happening in rapid succession after the football game against Michigan on Oct. 30.The events included a **riot** in which two cars were flipped and several couch burnings;  two shootings (one of which in downtown East Lansing) and **an armed man near campus**.

To top it off, Brandon Santo, a Grand Valley State student who was visiting MSU, went missing on Oct. 29.George McLaughlin, a junior, was near the post-game disturbances.  
\*“Lately it’s been weird,” McLaughlin said. “When Brandon went missing last week, my friend said one of his buddies had a van pull up to him and ask him to get in the car, and he said no. It was pretty sketchy.”\*\*

The search for Santo has been highly visible, with flyers printed both on and off-campus. Michigan State’s administration has started issuing official updates, despite Santo not being a local student. This level of exposure has students thinking about how best to safely go about their days.

Amanda Makemson said she is pleased that the search is being given proper weight and communication by the university, but is still extra careful.“Last year I felt super unsafe,” Makemson said.

“But even with everyone back, **it still does feel unsafe at times. I wouldn’t go walking around campus super late.** I always try to look out for myself.”",0.0604,0.4448,0.4947

Let's say 4% aren't vaccinated (based on the above survey). That would give a whopping total of 39k unvaxed docs. BUT... 45% of those planned to get vaxed, let's say they're now vaxed.

So depending on what type of graduate school you’re interested in I’d check to see if they recalculate GPA.,0.0593,0.657,0.2837

An undergraduate student who received a grade of 2.0 or above, CR, or P in a course may not repeat the course on a credit basis. An undergraduate student may repeat no more than 20 credits in courses in which grades below 2.0 were received.

20568,"Advisors at MSU can help with the process to transfer to another institution (no one takes it personally that you may wanna leave for your own reasons) but only to a certain extent. Be clear with them about your intent to transfer so they can better understand why you’re taking the classes you’re taking (esp if it looks out of the ordinary). But it ultimately falls on you to know 

- Transfer policies at the other university
- When the transfer application is due for the other university (and overall timeline)
- Any pre-reqs the major at the other university needs you to have before transferring (if applicable) 
- Communicating with the admissions office or the academic advisor at the other university how many credits you can transfer over and what could count as what (they probably have a website similar to https://transfer.msu.edu) 

Something to also keep in mind is what if transferring doesn’t end up working out, do you have a Plan B? Did the classes you plan on taking for the purpose of transferring still relevant to your MSU major to not delay your academic progress?",0.0827,0.7907,0.1267

MSU is ranked pretty high globally for communication, and theres a lot of cool concentration options (even one involving research and analytics) so id say its pretty dope. i also wouldn’t say that the classes are blowoffs, com 240 was actually pretty hard for most. so yeah, i enjoy it so far. its cool having professors and being in a program that rlly makes a difference in the field.",0.9816,0.0146,0.0037
