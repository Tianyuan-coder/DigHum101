Pretty sure this is common for any room, but it gets HOT in the winter due to the incessant heat from the radiator that you have very little control over. I dealt with it by keeping my window open all the time and adjusting my box fan while wearing warm clothes. 

About room sizes, you're gonna have a smaller space then most of the other rooms. But compared to the other permanent singles, you won't really know until you get there. My neighbor had a permanent single as well and his dorm was at most 3/4 the size of mine, but we were paying the same rate. Since the building is so old, many of the rooms don't follow a single standard so it's pretty much the luck of the draw for which one you'll get. 

Also following the advice of other comments, don't bring more then you need to. Be prepared to make 5-8 trips up three flights of stairs in 85+ degree weather on move in, you don't want those trips to involve really heavy items.

For Group-2, CEM-161 is a breeze. You don‚Äôt really get assignments, most of what you need to do will get done in class. The final is a presentation on the last day of class and the best part is you only take it once a week.

They share their on duty shifts with the Owen RAs though so if you call the phone past 7pm you may not get a face you recognize.

Van Hoosen is kind of like an addition to Owen, so your primary service desk (where you pick up packages, trash bags, rent out loaner keys, vacuums, carts, etc) is gonna be in Owen, but it's not exactly a far walk and it's the only 24hr desk in River Trail so it's not that bad.

481,"Hey I'm a transfer that originally wanted to be a veterinarian! I think it's worth noting I didn't go that way and it's not an easy path. You can't transfer to MSU into the pre-vet program, meaning either you need to pretty much start over at year 1 or go for a different major with similar classes, either way there's a 4 year program msu recommends for future veterinarians, but I believe you can technically take the big test to get into the veterinary program at any time. Just depends if the classes you've taken before have prepared you enough. 

I'd email an advisor since obviously I'm just some person on reddit. You can find the transfer advisors emails online and you can talk with them before you even apply. I wish I would've known that sooner, the one I got in contact with was very helpful.

It's not gonna be easy, but if it's what you truly want to do it'll be worth it. And if you get there and decide ""uhh nahhh"" then msu has so, so many different things to offer. I still ended up finding my place!

As for transferring to MSU and getting accepted into the school in the first place, I know they won't ask for your high school records and iirc they won't really ask about what happened at your first college if it was so long ago and you already retook the classes.

Considering there are thousands of business schools in the country, top 25 is quite good. Overall Broad has very strong job placement in most majors. You can get a great job anywhere in the country out of Broad, but you have to have good grades, pursue internships, leadership positions in student groups, etc.

As others have mentioned, Broad is mostly known for Supply Chain and Accounting, although the General Management and Marketing departments are very respectable. Broad's Achilles heel is the Finance department, which is ranked outside of the top 50 and is not a target school for top finance positions (not to say finance majors don't get good jobs). Broad would be ranked much higher if Finance didn't lag so far behind the rest of the college.

Pregaming, yes, wonderful, part of the experience. But please don't get absolutely hammered. If you are feeling bad, you aren't going to have fun, your friends won't have fun taking care of you, and basically everyone I know has been fallen on by drunk freshman who can't stand upright. Don't be that freshman. 

Next, seats. There is no bad section in the student section. The only places for freshman to avoid is the very very front. This is for seniors and juniors. Trust me, they can smell the freshman-ness on you and will heckle you until you move. Just move a tiny bit up and you won't run into issues. 

Next, going into the stadium. I think the rules have changed this year that you can now bring clear bags into the stadium. Double check that, but I think so. Whatever the rules are, don't try and fight them. You won't win, I promise. The people who are clearing you to enter the stadium have seen and heard everything and don't have time to explain why your backpack or open bottle can't come in. They WILL make you throw it out. Save the embarrassment and just don't bring it. 

Someone yells go green, you yell go white at the exact same volume. It is your job.

Finally, really do try and have fun! If you go into the games thinking ""I hate football I'm only going because I feel like I have to"" yeah, you won't have fun. So do yourself a favor and go with people you like and try and be excited you are in the student section because it's an incredibly hype and fun place to be!

Second, in my experience in literally just under a year I find that having the Michigan State/Broad name has A LOT of connections and people working basically everywhere. I won‚Äôt say which firm for privacy reasons lol but it hires a lot of interns and grads from MSU, and they keep that connection tight and I honestly believe it helped me a lot as my recruiter and interviewer were both MSU alums. Obviously they don‚Äôt recruit you just because you slapped that university name on your resume, but there‚Äôs a connection there where you can talk about what you‚Äôre doing on campus, and can even be a great conversation to get to know them better (recruiters and interviewers love someone who is human.

But for real it depends on the dorm you're in. I was in East McDonel and learned if you have more than one load and you only have fri/sat/sun, wake up before 9 and get down there. 

The machines really can't hold a lot, a weeks worth of laundry for me was about one and a half loads which I just split into two for the washers and combined into one when I threw it in the dryer (although my thicker clothes would always need to be hung up to dry longer). You definitely don't wanna overstuff the washers either. Last year someone lost their clothes and we lost a washer for a few weeks because it caught on fire from being overstuffed. 

Washers take about 20-35 minutes depending on your settings and dryers are always an hour. Don't take your clothes out before the hour is up because there's no way to reset the timer other than waiting and no ones clothes with be completely dry after the 10 minutes you left on one of the machines. Check the lint trap before you put your clothes in there (unless you like collecting other people's lint) and try to clean it after. 

All in all they're not the best machines but they usually get the job done. Set a schedule that works for you but be prepared for it to be thrown all out of wack if you do your laundry during peak times.",0.0701,0.3497,0.5802

642,"I loveee cats, I've had cats since I was born. College is my first time without a cat, and while I miss them to death I really think it was the right choice. 

If you're getting a cat that's under 4 or 5 years old, they're gonna need constant care and attention. You really can't do that if you're in class or doing homework or out with friends. If you don't give them enough attention and space they're gonna be animals and they're gonna get into all your stuff. Hell even if you do everything right they're gonna get into your stuff and find ways to annoy you and make you buy a new desk chair every other month (probably my greatest expense of 2019). Multiply all of this by 20 if you're getting a cat under a year old. Many reputable adoption places won't actually give you a cat if it'll be completely alone for more than a few hours a day. Or will only be allowed in your room for most of the day. It's considered cruel for a kitten. 

If you are gonna adopt a younger cat, think about it as you would like having a pre-teen while you're in college really. They're gonna piss you off and you need to feed them and buy them stuff to live. You really shouldn't leave them alone for too long and if you look away and don't have your stuff properly hidden they'll get into all sorts of stuff they really shouldn't. You'll probably need to skip a class every once in awhile because they're sick and need to go to the doctor or they threw up on your bed and you can't just leave that sitting there. You'll probably need to consider skipping clubs or not going out on the weekends because they need that bonding time or else they won't even know you.

If you're getting a cat that's 8+ years old they're gonna be a lot more mature and probably won't get into as much as a younger cat. You can probably also leave them alone for longer and they wont destory your things... but they're also older so they need a lot more help when they do need to do stuff and a lot more patience for them to get to know you. This actually means spending more time with the cat and spending more money on vet bills and depending on the cat probably not expecting cuddles every night. 

As someone who knows cats I would honestly feel extraordinarily guilty getting one in college when I know I don't have the time/money/patience for it.

... butttttt there's a cat cafe in East Lansing that always needs volunteers!!! If you think you have the time and patience for a cat try volunteering there for a semester. If you don't have the time to do that a few times a week you definitely don't have the time to take care of a cat, and on the other side you really get to learn how to truly take care of cats and help pick out the right homes for them. If at the end you decide you have the time and the patience and you still want a cat, then you can adopt one from there too! They're all shelter cats. 

Also on a more positive note, I have a friend who has a cat in college and that cat has brought a lot of light to their life. But they actually take most of their classes online and dropped their job to take care of her better. 

It's a huge responsibility and there are ways to make sure you're prepared before jumping right in. I'm not saying it's the wrong choice, but college is a lot about focusing on yourself and adopting a cat is really like adopting a child, which many people wouldn't be able to do in college.",0.0818,0.3443,0.5739

It is a living creature and they have personalities that will determine how you interact with it.  Some cat's choose a person, so if you bring a cat in and it shows more affection to another roommate, you may be put out a bit and be stuck being the one that supports it but may not get the attention you want.  This can lead to you not really feeling connected.

If the cat bonds to you, it may want to be around you alot and will be distressed if you're gone for long amounts of time, so you'll have to take into consideration what your travelling plans are.  I have a cat that if I'm gone for a day will be throwing themselves at the door to get at me.

Another is their health.  If you end up getting a cat with an undisclosed or undiscovered health issue, things can get expensive really fast.  Like thousands of dollars to find out what's wrong and the same to fix it.  If you have the financial means to do such then by all means but if not, you're either euthanizing or surrendering, which will most likely end up in euthanizing.

That's kind of the doom and gloom of it.  If things work out, it's a great time.  I can't imagine not having my cats and am lucky they get a long and are healthy.  Every day they make me laugh but they do have a huge influence on my life.  It's kind of a gamble.",0.191,0.4426,0.3664

Had a common open bathroom where the toilets had no dividers or stalls - just a row of toilets along one wall immediately next to each other so when you were taking a crap another guy could basically be sitting on the crapper next to you so close your knees were basically touching.

909,"Hi, I'm Dr. Dolson! Obviously I can't give a good perspective on what taking one of my exams is like as a student, but I can confirm that they will be open-note and have questions directly pulled from the study guide (as in, when you take the exam, I will literally roll dice to determine which questions from the study guide to ask you). I know the oral exam format can seem really scary and intimidating if you're not used to it, so I try to do everything I can to mitigate that. In general, people did pretty well on them last time. One thing that's really nice about this format is that if you're on the wrong track with your answer I can give you a gentle nudge in the right direction and you can get partial credit where you wouldn't have been able to on a paper exam.

One caveat is that I can't 100% confirm I'll be doing oral exams this semester. We just added a bonus online section of 431 because demand was so high, and I'm still waiting to see how many TAs I'll get to account for the increased number of students. Doing oral exams is a lot of work, so I need to make sure I have enough person-power to make them happen before I finalize plans. I'm really hoping it will work out, though, because I've gotten a lot of positive feedback on the oral exam format (especially from students who have gone on to do technical interviews for software development jobs).

I'm a returning student living here, and I've been utterly shocked by my roach-bodycount. This parallels stories you hear from 'Howard University', and I almost walked across campus one night to sleep in my car. MSU is on the 'Covid-budget' and you can tell by their gross negligence to pest control.

Ice machines in the east side are broken, and the west side ice machine is overwhelmed with roaches. I went to the 7-11 for ice on 8/10 due to alarmingly large roaches swarming my feet. 

To keep away roaches, I've essentially slept with lights on 24/7 &amp; have added an additional LED light under my bed. As a returning IT professional, this has been a literal nightmare. 

Before I leave, I'm going to put my expensive PC equipment in large garbage bags, spray Raid for 30 seconds, and seal them air-tight. I cannot risk bringing pests from McDonel hall to my next place of stay, and have been utterly disappointed. I may have to dispose of $5k worth of equipment due to roach infestation, and don't think that I have any legal recourse.

However, I hear there are similar issues w/ apartments along grand-river (even fairly new units). With the new housing developments, EL has become frankly overwhelmed w/ roaches in recent years. (Even 1855, a complex built in 2017-2018)

If it were me, I'd possibly get a sturdy PC stand that allows your rig to get adequate air flow. That way you can keep your PC out of dust, and will have enough space for your monitors, chargers, keyboard, mic, etc. on your standard desk.

Also, if I were not living alone in a double, I may not have enough outlets to even run my 2 monitors. It might be worth bringing a 6-7 port wall adapter + a 15 ft ethernet cord.

Pros- good location. Buses 31 (takes you to GR, North, and Brody) and 30 (South) stop right out front. A lot of people call river trail center campus but McDonel is definitely more east, but not as east as east itself. Hubbard is a short walk and they got chicken tendies and mozzy sticks that will be half your diet. Has a Spartys! I went down there in my PJs to grab some pizza rolls so many times. It's a life saver if you have an online meeting or just don't wanna leave the dorm. IMO a dining hall would be a bit better though. 

Cons- Depending on what floor you're on it might be loud. The broad kids like to party, they're East floors 1-3 and I can't comment on the rest. Akers is gonna be your main dining hall with... mixed reviews. I got food poisoning a few times and stopped going there second semester. It's worth it to take 31 to Brody. 

I think the dos and donts of every dorm apply. Don't be super loud and obnoxious, if you wanna make friends during move in week keep your door open, everyone can hear everything that happens in the hallways so be careful, clean your dorm so you hopefully don't have a roach problem, respect your roommate, etc etc.",0.2335,0.4761,0.2903

1154,Hey have you found an answer to this ?,0.0325,0.8345,0.133
1155,"Ayo, I went to community. It definitely has its ups and down but imo way more ups. I worked part time making half decent money throughout it and had very little to no issues. I highly suggest working throughout community especially if you're already a 4.0 student and money's an issue. 

On the flip side it may also be a bit of a gamble. When you go to community college with intentions to apply to a university after, pretty much all your high school accomplishments become obsolete. I'm still a little sad that all the effort I put into high school really went nowhere minus a few AP credits. Also yes you're right, you do have to cram 4 years of internships, TAing, clubs, research, and whatever else you want to do into two years. I'll be honest I felt pretty behind and overwhelmed my first semester, but by my second I was working again, doing research, and VP of a new club. If you're motivated you can still do everything you want to do in those 2 years, just a shame it feels so short. 

As far as MSU's pay for student jobs, yeah it won't pay off your loans but it will give you some spending money which you will need no matter how great your dining plan. I think working throughout community college really set me up to find what I was looking for in a job at school, which helped immensely. 

I don't have a direct answer, it's up to you. If my parents were fully willing to spent the 14k and I had 5.5k I probably would have happily went right out of high school. The 4 year experience is way, way more interactive and has many more opportunities than just community college. But I can't deny I ended up with some really valuable real life experiences (and scholarships) I never would have gotten if I went to MSU immediately. I don't think it's fair to say community college is the answer to all issues, but if you don't feel ready or don't have the money it's absolutely an option.

Even if work needed it, if your doctor didn't order it, your insurance may not cover it.  If you just walked into a specialized doctor's office say for an x-ray. They would ask if you had a referral or order for it from your doctor. If you don't they might still do it, but would probably charge you the full amount and your insurance might not deem it as necessary and would not cover it.
So in this case, it would be 3rd party testing.  If you didn't report symptoms and a doctor didn't refer you, insurance might see it as unnecessary and deny the claim.

Back in my day SCM was not a competitive major to get into once you got into Broad. Because of the program's reputation, tons of students started majoring in SCM, many of whom had no interest in the subject and just wanted a high-paying job. The class sizes were getting too big and MSU started getting negative feedback from employers on the quality of students going into internships/entry level jobs. Broad then decided to make SCM a competitive major to get into, in order to limit the size of the program and have a filter for students who are not serious about the subject and hurt the school's reputation. I would attend some SCMA meetings and network with older students to see if this is something you are actually interested in.

Overall SCM still has very high job placement and is heavily recruited by companies all over the country. I suspect this will not slow down anytime soon as companies reconfigure their supply chains post-COVID and hire people with degrees in the field. Like anything though, the top jobs (Fortune 100 rotational programs, high-paying tech companies, consulting) go to the top students. You still need very strong grades, student org involvement, and internship experience (ideally multiple internships or coops) to get the best jobs, as you are still competing with your peers and students from other top SCM schools outside of MSU.",0.129,0.4881,0.3829

Mary Mayo Hall: One of the most widespread legends on campus is the haunting of Mary Mayo Hall. A portrait of the buildings namesake hangs on the first floor, with eyes that are reported to follow you through the room. Though Mary Mayo died almost 30 years before the hall was built from illness, her spirit is said to walk the halls. A woman‚Äôs figure is seen in the West lounge and a piano that plays by itself are some of the unexplainable occurrences reported in Mary Mayo Hall. The fourth floor, often referred to as the ‚Äúred room‚Äù has been completely sealed off. Satanic rituals are alleged to have taken place, as well as a young woman hanging herself. Unexplained lights and figures can sometimes be seen in the windows of the fourth floor.

1703,"Hello, I am the one that sent out that email. Funny to see it show up on here. I can promise that the email you received and the offer was in no way shape or form a scam, I apologize if it came off that way.

To answer some of these comments some people responded with:

* We pay through Venmo, PayPal, and Zelle as it is easiest and most convenient for college students, and allows us to keep everything organized for tax purposes.
* You may be surprised by the rate we are paying tutors, but it is completely legitimate, we have had over 40 tutors work with us in the past and each of them can assure you that this is the True rate that they were paid. Please respond to my email if you don't believe me and I will send proof.
* You won't find me on LinkedIn because I do not personally use the platform. Search ""Spartan Tutors"" and you will find our account. It may not be filled out fully though as it was not a primary method of marketing that we have been using.

As a member of our team pointed out in another comment, check out our website ([csetutorsmsu.com](https://csetutorsmsu.com)) to verify that there is a real service we are providing. 

Our team has helped over 120 students in the past and will help far more this upcoming year.

Overall, I am glad that this post was made to clear things up for some people. However, I do ask that it is taken down as we do provide a fully legitimate service and in no way shape or form are trying to scam anybody and I'd rather it doesn't come off that way.

If you have any questions on the legitimacy of the service we provide please respond to my email and I'll clear it up there.

Thanks!",0.4552,0.4537,0.0912

We provide tutoring for, mostly CSE, students at MSU who struggle with specific classes. We reached out to potential tutors as the demand grew and we could not helo students because there were no tutors available.
Feel free to answer the email and we can set up a call so you can meet us and talk this through.

Unpopular opinion, but ignore all the bad reviews and bad grades this class has. I took this last semester with only a tiny bit of programming experience (literally scratch from my sophomore year of high school lol) and I 4.0. I even did the projects the super late (like one or two days before due). 

Just this class you just gotta practice ( like any other class) and have a passion for cs. At one point I started helping people in this class while taking it as well and what mind boggled me was the amount of people just doing CS for the money and just expecting to breeze through the class. And the reason the prof might seem like dickheads is because they want you to actually do the work and not copy code to just get by and not know what going on in your code (which is a big no no at msu). Like as long, you actually want to do the work and be passionate, this class will be a breeze. 

My advice to not struggle is 
1 form a group with people. 
Helping each out will make homework and studying easier but also make you a smarter programmer, like sometimes I can recognize a error in someone code much faster because I seen it else where in the past.
2 go to help room. 
Go early. that‚Äôs it because the night a project is due, the wait is ridiculous
3 learn how to use the debugger.
Of all the people I was helping in this class. 90% just didn‚Äôt know use the debugger to find a error in 200+ lines of code and was checking one line at a time. Brutal.
4 practice old exams
Pretty much similar to what they test you 
5 ask your ta 
They will help you and want you to actually learn. You don‚Äôt like your ta? Email another one from another section and just ask nicely.
6 want more help?
Use the internet, look up that method and see what it exactly does. My favorite resources are w3schools, geeksforgeeks, or just YouTube.

I lived in McDonel and beds there were always lofted by default. The supports on the bed consisted of two sets of wooden posts which stacked on top of each other. The posts were held in place with four metal pegs so that they didn't fall off. So you could pick up the top half of the bedframe and actually lower it down to the ground, OR raise it up and stack it on top of a different bedframe.

So basically we'd take one lofted bed and lower it to the ground in the manner described above. Then we'd take the second bed and stack it on top of the first, making sure to put the pegs in place so it wouldn't fall apart.

Typically once you graduate your loans are in deferment for 6 months, which means you are not on the hook to pay them. If you can though, start paying them off while you are in school. Like others have said, unsubsidized loans accrue interest every day since you first take out that loan while subsidized loans do not accrue any interest until after deferment. I would also talk to your advisor about different scholarship opportunities and just keep applying to those as much as you can. Did you happen to fill out a FAFSA?

For freshmen entering that cannot get spaced in for the Spring 23' semester, their recommendation is to plan to rent an apartment off campus.  

In other words, they took in too many students, and they are now expecting families to find an apartment because they say ""it is unlikely on-campus will be available in Spring 23'"".  They have no one to assist families with finding off-campus housing.  And total disregard for the safety, well-being, or extra cost that will result on top of tuition for incoming students.

on thursdays they do 5 dollar sushi which actually is pretty decent, it's made fresh in the store.  They used to do pizzas and sandwiches but I think stopped cause of covid but may be coming back.

if you want an old timey kind of feel there's westlunds apple market on saginaw.  Good place for meat and hot deli items.

3367,"Hey, I went to school here and am returning after a 6yr hiatus. I was assaulted in the parking lot of those student apartments by the river I haven't been back to campus since it happened so I don't remember the name. Guys are careless and it seems like the mentality is being excused as passable or normal, but as someone who comes from a small town this was quite jarring for me. I had seen it happened at home, but the level it happens (especially in certain settings) is not okay. I had a lot of trouble with people respecting my boundaries and this made me feel worthless. (Which, let's be honest, hooting and yelling at people is clearly disrespect of their boundaries and it shows some entitlement like being owed something from whomever you're yelling at.) Of course, things were made worse after I was assaulted and I stopped going to classes/work entirely. 

&amp;#x200B;

Never go anywhere alone. Always carry pepper gel. Scream if someone makes you uncomfortable. Loudly yell at guys not to follow you, it will embarrass them. Tell them their breath smells. Tell them no and to leave you alone. Be mean. Give the same energy they do back to them. But if you are going to be mean make sure you have pepper gel in case they get really aggressive.

\*\*If you will be drinking, make sure you have a secure way home or else you are better off drinking where you will sleep that night.\*\*

No, they're being disgusting because they believe it is ok to be disgusting. It isn't.  And you shouldn't have to deal with this.   


Catcalling is done from a distance (also not ok). Harassment is what you're experiencing and that is far worse.

It doesn't make it ok.  This past weekend was pretty crazy.  It won't always be like this. Tailgating will be, but there are also police walking  around that you can report people for harassment.  It sounds like you were with friends.  There is strength in numbers. Empower each other to speak up against then.  Invite guy friends to go places with you.  If you know someone well enough, see if they will walk you home. I have walked with girls I know, and strangers.  Stay in populated and frequented routes.

The buck stops at the top. Stanley is a merticrat, and doesn't see people as having intrinsic value, which is why you see more managers than there should be. 


The mentality is that these jobs are easy, people are lazy, and it's an honor to work for the University. Plus all the ""great benefits"". 


They offer no incentive to stay. Unions are weak and busted. 


I left after years of empty unfulfilled commitments and ever increasing workload. I managed a department that once had 9 people. When I left, through organic attrition, it was down to 4. The department workload had doubled in that time, and my personal workload was significantly greater than any of my predecessors because I was assigned special projects beyond the scope of my regular duties. 


Since I left, I have not been replaced, and one of my former employees gave their notice this week.

They were hired because the admin has decided that we're an ""R1 research university"". Their job is to bring in research dollars and graduate Ph.D. students (whether or not the industry needs them). Why are faculty limiting admission to upper-level programs? Because there isn't the capacity to teach them, pure and simple.  Faculty are evaluated predominantly based on the amount of research money they bring in, the number of PhDs graduated, and the number of journal manuscripts published - not on the number of student credit hours taught.  So if you're unhappy with the system, don't take it out on the faculty (or the students).

MSU Bikes sells and repairs bikes under Bessey, right near the center of campus. They take pride in their work and bike culture overall, so anything bought there is likely to be treated well if you need service (and they have a 24/7 DIY repair station outside their door)

MSU Surplus has historically had 2 big bike sales per year - mostly bikes that get abandoned after finals and move-out. They‚Äôve been part of the same department as MSU Bikes for about a decade, so anything you buy there has likely been inspected and tuned up already unless it‚Äôs ‚Äúparts‚Äù or ‚Äúas-is‚Äù

Tim (director of MSU Bikes) was always pretty active in the Lansing Bikes Co-op last I knew, and it‚Äôs a natural source for recruiting for the shop, so the products and services may be different but it‚Äôs still part of the same larger community. If your bike just needs some TLC or basic repairs, you can pay a few bucks an hour to use their workshop and volunteer techs will help you learn how to do whatever you need.

(I'm somewhat concerned about the future of the ""Computer Science"" commenter that doesn't know this is possible....)

Assume that the prof that gives this warning knows how to find, and will be looking for, cheating.) D2L also records every file you open in the course and how long you had it open, and every IP address that logs into D2L from your account. (Although if your quiz is open-notes, they are probably monitoring to ensure you didn't have someone else help you rather than whether you are using course resources. But, as someone else mentioned, don't copy and paste or otherwise plagiarize from the lesson page on your quiz - the instructor will surely recognize the wording and themes from any materials they assigned to you.

Blind studies have shown that experienced graders can detect their own students' work vs work done by contract cheaters between 65-90% of the time (because they are experts in pattern recognition!). My experience has been that it is often extremely obvious when someone else starts helping my students with their work or doing work on their behalf. When a cheater falls in my lap, I then have to go through the process of gathering evidence. This is, by far, the worst part of my job - there might be professors that revel in catching cheaters, but I don't know any.

I'd say I'm interested in in the filmmaking/video editing side. 

As for what I could get out of it and personal projects, I remember having a conversation with my uncle about not knowing what I want to major in or do and fearing that I at this rate I may never figure it out. He said, ""You're a creative person in a world where it's never been easier to put stuff out into the world."" and said he's really surprised that I haven't ever tried my hand at starting a podcast because I ""have a bunch of niche interests that would be sure to appeal to someone"". I mentioned to him that I watch a lot of video essays and film commentary/analysis channels on YouTube and have toyed with the idea of doing my spin on that as a hobby right now to keep my ADHD brain occupied when I'm not working or at school and need something exciting. 

However when I was younger (7th-9th grade-ish) I thought I wanted to be a fiction author and I still have a bunch of story ideas floating around in ye old noggin, but over the years since I've played around with video editors and stuff for fun and started doing most of my high school presentations as videos when it was allowed because it made it more fun for me. The more I tinkered with that side of my creativity, I've started to become more interested in that method of storytelling and some of my stories just seem to want that too. 

Sometimes I think you go to create a piece of art and during that process it sometimes (in some strange way) decides for itself what it wants to be, almost as if you've developed it enough to almost seem like a breathing thing and you just sort of have to roll with it and let that guide you. And some of them just feel like they'd be better off written in the form of something like a script or little web series or something in that realm. When I came across this degree it interested me because not only would it serve me well in my hobbies but it seems the knowledge and resources it provides would give me the tools I need (provided I use them well) to nurture those ideas until they can live outside of my head.",0.6093,0.3403,0.0504

They only accept certified mail carriers like USPS, UPS, Amazon, etc. Full list is at [https://liveon.msu.edu/packages](https://liveon.msu.edu/packages).
2. If it was shipped by a certified carrier, did you get a shipping number with updates? Your service center should be able to check if the package was received and possibly labelled incorrectly or resent out for some reason.
3. Did you get an update from the service center the day it was delivered? Packages take time to log, and when they're done being logged you will get an email from the service center saying your package is ready to be picked up. It won't be there any other time.

I only managed to do one internship my senior year, and I can say with confidence that that was the most meaningful experience I participated in in college, and the thing that directly lead to the job I have now.  

Whether or not want to continue in academics after your undergraduate degree, the degree is not as important as the connections you make with your fellow students, with professors, and the opportunities that MSU offers. Join student organizations, apply for internships, participate in research, enter competitions/conferences/exhibitions and take on challenges outside of your studies, and you will get so much more out of college than just the knowledge you learn in the classroom!

4784,"OFF-CAMPUS PLAN  
Students living in Owen Hall, Williams Hall, Van Hoosen Hall, University Apartments, 1855 Place, or at off-campus properties can purchase meals in bundles. Students living off-campus are also welcome to purchase an unlimited dining plan, listed under ‚ÄòOn-campus Plans‚Äô above.  
  
Mobile ordering is only included as a Combo-X-Change (CX) option for students with a Silver, Gold or Platinum plan. If a student living off campus would like to purchase one of the unlimited plans, they must do so over the phone by calling 517-355-2274.  
  
With an off-campus plan, you save up to $4.25 per meal off of the standard public rate when visiting our dining halls. Please note you do not have to purchase the quantities listed below. The meals can be purchased in any quantity of 10. For example, if you would like 30 meals, enter ""3"" as the quantity for the DineOn 10 on the ordering page.  
  
DINEON 10 | $77.50  
DINEON 25 | $193.75  
DINEON 50 | $387.50  
DINEON 100 | $775  
DINEON 150 | $1,162.50  
  
Meal accesses can be used at all-you-care-to-eat locations or as a Combo-X-Change (CX) at participating locations. Learn more about CX in our FAQs! Guests with off-campus plans can use multiple CX meals per day. One meal is deducted for each use. Meals can also be used to bring guests to eat with you.  
  
Off-campus plans remain active as long as you have your ID card and use at least one meal from July 1-June 30. Dining plans not used during this time frame will be deactivated.  
  
Off-campus dining plans are non-transferable and non-refundable. After a student graduates, as long as they keep their ID card and use a minimum of one meal per year from July 1-June 30, meals remain on their card for use. Michigan State University reserves the right to change the terms of use for dining plans.

There's so many things to do at MSU and if you try to do all of it you'll end up not really doing any of it.

4853,"So I set out to do a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering in 2016, I quickly realized I did not really want to be ‚Äúdoing‚Äù Electrical Engineering, though I did want to be educated about electronics. I did the minor in CS when I discovered that I could complete it and still graduate in 4 years without having to push myself too hard. I started doing the courses for it the summer after my junior year. I foresaw myself attending a Computer Science Masters program a long time ago, arguably in middle school I decided I wanted to do the EE bachelors and a Masters in CS, so I am a bit of a unique situation in knowing what I want to do, since many do not.

I started the Masters degree in January 2020 at Syracuse University via Online classes (say what you will about Online Schooling, but this is a fantastic (and pricey) program). I have completed 7/11 classes, and I can honestly say that the Minor in CS at MSU prepared me very well for this program. There is only one class the minor could have had me take that would have helped, an undergrad level operating systems class, but I looked into the optional prerequisites and took the one that applied. Only half of the content in that one class was new material to me.

During the first CS minor class, the Python course, I was doing an Internship where I applied Python every day. I went on to get a job with that company, ASML, and have since continued my software tenure from there. The company has offered to pay for portions of my degree as a result of this.

I work along side other Electrical Engineers and can have a conversation with them about electronics, even though many of them have much more experience. Mainly my job is data analysis, hardware manipulation with software (i.e. making actuators move or solenoids open/close), data collection, UI design, and signal processing.

I have latched onto Python as my preferred language, even though it is not the first language I ever used or learned, yet it is extremely comfortable and friendly to me.

What I recommend, do a masters in computer science. Whether or not you actually want to do more school. The minor definitely prepared you well. And make sure if they try to get you to take extra courses, pay attention to what the content of those courses are before you sign up.

Yes fossil fuels feed the grid. But so does solar, wind, hydro, and nuclear. 

Also, the fossil fuels used at piwer stations are used at a much higher efficiency with a much great degree of environmental control and stewardship than ICE powered private vehicles. 

In addition, making sustainable energy changes at a supply level is far more economical than implementing sustainability change at a consumption level. Way more bang for your buck. Phasing out technology and products that have an integrated planned obsolescence, or relatively low mean time to failure, while phasing in new technologies at the supply side and consumption side is the best option.

Yes EVs have their issues. Sourcing of materials, mining and processing, etc. However, all those arguments are strawman propaganda. Those same issues exist with ICE vehicle manufacturering but with oil extraction, fuel refinement, and fuel transportation added on.  And those last three are not a significant part of EVs. Yes you see pictures of EVs plugged into fossil fuel generators. But, look at that situation as  just having a temporary hybrid. And it's an exception,  not a rule.


Basically, the EV revolution train has left the station. One way or another ICE engine usage will become obsolete. Do people still use horses? Sure. But they have become niche, and luxury. The same will be True of ICE. 


As for limitations on available resources. There are limitations on the current methods for extraction and sourcing based on the current economic methods for meeting demand for those materials. Once supply diminishes, demand increases, and price increases, alternative methods, that are currently not economical because of cost, will suddenly become economical and will be developed. ""Not enough copper, not enough lithium"" is all bullshit. There is plenty. It's just a matter of how expensive extraction is. Once prices hit a certain level, then it'll come. 

Also, there are alternative materials being developed all the time. Billions are being poured into private and public research for batteries, conductors, inductors, electronics, etc. That use alternative materials and methods.

Those panels do incur costs to IPF and land management which are still being argued about. While they are saving money on one cost center they are losing money on another. 


The coal to LNG change over was hamfisted. The supply lines of LNG to the power plants were undersized to manage the transition at the time, resulting in an inability to generate sufficient power to meet demand locally. That resulted in MSU buying power from the grid, which cost the University money. Years went by before consumers was able to install larger supply lines to the plant. 

The new generators in the powerplant, the RICE generators you mentioned were cut down in capacity before installation and are much lower capacity than originally planned, which once the current LNG generators are decommissioned in the next 10 years, the power plant will again be under performing and need to buy power from the grid. But that's OK! Because when FRIB was installed new transmission lines were installed to facilitate that. 

The digester is small. It's about the size of one tractor trailer. It doesn't generate enough fuel to make a material difference in power consumption at the university. It is an experimental test bed. Though it does stink to high heaven and cause a biohazard nightmare.

I'm thinking that in Gupta resigning, the board sees it as a negative towards the school that is potentially opening them up to some litigation risk, where Stanley and the Provost see it as an accountability/autonomy/academic governance issue regardless of optics, in addition to following the Title IX reporting mandates.

It is possible that you could swing by DECS in the engineering building for a friendly chat. They *might* be able to give you some advice or let you borrow tools in the office, but that is only because they are kind, not because they ""owe"" you anything. They are super busy this part of the year, but if you come in after having done as much research as possible on how to get to the battery (look up ""specific laptop model"" + ""battery"" on youtube) and say what you are trying to do and that you are only looking for basic advice and maybe to use tools, they might be able to spare you a moment.

I hesitate to suggest them as they are not meant for fixing random people's computers or reeeaaaally anything that is not EGR specific (not even EGR people's personal stuff), but they have often been able to spare a suggestion when they are free. That being said, I have built a 10 year relationship with them and am pretty technically savvy at tearing stuff down myself.

Anywho! Step 1: look up how to take access the battery on youtube. Maybe even buy an iFixit kit :) It's a super useful skill to have and I've saved people $100s of dollars by helping them fix stuff!

Step 0 might actually be to run the battery diagnostic tool to see if that is the issue (though it really sounds like it is).

I might be able to answer minor questions here (not PM so others can also get [nerd-sniped](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/nerd_sniping.png)) if only to give you the confidence that you are on the right track and can do it yourself.

Alternatively, there are computer stores in the area that can likely fix your issue for a fee.

Gupta was involved in some title IX (sexual harassment) deal at the business college. It was probably bad. Stanley was notified and personally decided not to fire him. 

Gupta eventually ends up getting fired because of another person, with Stanley's consent, and now the university board probably thinks 1) Stanley's handling of the whole matter was not good enough and more importantly 2) they are going to be legally liable for potentially massive legal issues unless they fire Stanley, and they're panicking trying to avoid that. 

Clearly it looks really bad to go through so many presidents so quickly, but there's some powerful motivator for the board (my guess is money and the university's potential liability) for them to get him out of here.

&gt;So Basically it's like this:   
&gt;  
&gt;Stanley, the Provost, and Gupta came to a mutual agreement that he (Gupta) would resign for failing to adhere to title IX reporting guidelines (for something that happened within Broad) as the dean of Broad and the BoT didn't like something about it, despite Stanley and the Provost following policy and Gupta acknowledging he was in the wrong.   
&gt;  
&gt;I'm thinking that in Gupta resigning, the board sees it as a public negative towards the school that might open them up to litigation risk, where Stanley and the Provost see it as an accountability/autonomy/academic governance issue regardless of optics, in addition to following the Title IX reporting mandates.   
&gt;  
&gt;The Faculty and Staff see the threat of punishing the president and Provost by the BoT for essentially doing the right thing as an overstep of boundaries having to do with the aforementioned autonomy in academic governance as an institution.   
&gt;  
&gt;If the board votes to fire Stanley, you could see some major push back from faculty and staff.

It happened last semester too to some kids too but I didn't find out what was going on until it was too late and I was charged for the loans they didn't take out on my end, sounds like its happening to more people this semester. 

Finaid giving everyone the complete run around when this is obviously a well known problem that's been going on for a better part of a year really makes me suspicious, but I did manage to get mine fixed. I just kept calling until I was put on hold and waited through hold - it probably took an hour or two and then lost it on the line since I'm really at my final straw with this stuff. Idk if I got lucky with the person I was talking to or what but she was aware of the glitch and managed to get mine fixed over the weekend. 

I don't know what's going on there but it's sketchy as shit, and if you really want to light a fire under them contact the ombudsperson ([https://ombud.msu.edu/schedule-appointment-contact](https://ombud.msu.edu/schedule-appointment-contact)). They're really where everyone should go to complain about Finaid since they're an unbiased person in charge of looking over governmental services in the university, but of course that isn't advertised to students (wonder why). 

I guess I should say though: first make sure you've completed FAFSA's loan counseling - the link will be under where you accepted your loans in the finaid portal. Also make sure you've accepted your full amount of subsidized and unsubsidized loans (or however much you need). If you gained scholarships or anything in the last month or two the amount you were offered may have changed and you may have to go through and do it again. But you should only have to do it ONCE after that. Part of the glitch is making people do it multiple times, and if you have to do that then that's a sign that you really gotta push finaid (or the ombudsperson if you don't wanna doddle).",0.0518,0.3543,0.5938

The ombudsperson (they should be an unbiased resource to complain about governmental departments too. Finaid counts): [https://ombud.msu.edu/schedule-appointment-contact](https://ombud.msu.edu/schedule-appointment-contact)

The people actually in charge of your scholarship (it's not finaid!). I found the person who was in charge of my transfer scholarships by emailing around after they were never added to my account this year. If you email admissions about your issue they should hopefully be able to get back with you (tell them the name of the scholarships(s) you got and ask if you can get in contact with the people department/people responsible for that scholarship).

A journalist. Any active journalist. I promise you're not alone in this, and I'm sure if you poke around they're around doing stories about this kind of stuff and could even maybe connect you with other people who are having similar issues.

I had him during his final semester (EGR 102 spring 2016). He didn‚Äôt teach well, got annoyed when people went to office hours to prepare well in advance for his exams since his lectures were insufficient, the majority class failed the exams due to the above and and poor test design, and he was resistant to examining his ability to teach or design tests as part of the problem, and he was happy to fail anyone and everyone. Terrible attitude and unprofessional conduct including but NOT limited to threatening to call the police on a student who arrived a couple minutes to an exam and was having a mental breakdown for being denied a test. I learned after he left that he actually told one of the TAs to get the police to handle her and the TA refused, so he backed down. Chris Paul was gone the next semester and has since been scrubbed from the faculty website. The only records I could find of his existence are the rate my professor reviews: https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2009001

And the MSU grades page: https://msugrades.com/instructors/CHRISTOPHER_J_PAUL/courses#egr-102

My advice: document every incident (words, sequence of events, location, time, witnesses) with any professor that may be considered poor conduct, unprofessional/malicious behavior, or a deviation from MSU policy so that a preponderance of evidence forces the university‚Äôs hands. The major lesson I learned from Chris J Paul is that institutions can tolerate a lot of disfunction until it‚Äôs sufficiently embarrassing, creates more internal work than taking action to fix it would require, or has the appearance of potentially opening the institution  up for a civil suit.",0.0098,0.1201,0.8701

Definitely keeps your privilege in check when you remember what it was like to have to clean up multiple ice cream cone bombs dropped from the top of the cafe stairs by inconsiderate peers who have never given a second thought to the people in their lives who provide seamless infrastructure for them. 

Lastly, back in my day 20 years ago, as maintenance supervisor I literally carried keys to every room in the building (dorm room master keys included, but only for requested maintenance and person not home).  I was occasionally called in the middle of the night for emergency puke clean up/dorm infrastructure needs because all the full time ‚Äúadults‚Äù were fast asleep at home. It built confidence for me in a leadership role in a dorm full of 1200 people. Perks included sneaking into the cafe for poptarts late at night, and literally exploring every single dorm storage/mechanical/rooftop room with the master keys; I have literally found where Freddie Krueger lives in the Holmes Hall boiler mechanical room at 1 am alone.

Also our heat went out in november and the apartment was below 60¬∞. they wouldn‚Äôt send someone to fix it bc it was the weekend and gave me heat lamps instead. turns out it‚Äôs a direct violation of the counties rules and only when my dad highlighted that part of their licensing rules and sent it back to them did they call someone out

also the place was soooo filthy when we moved in our feet were black from walking around barefoot. the bathroom sink was cracking and rusting and the toilet lid was broken off. there was someone else‚Äôs hair in the shower when we moved in. they took over a month to send anyone out to the apt.

also it really pissed me off that the pool was ‚Äúclosed pending water testing‚Äù until the end of july and we moved out in the beginning of august LOL

Most RAs absolutely do not care what rules you may be breaking in the privacy of your own room as long as you aren't hurting anyone, and (critically important) \*that isn't obvious outside of your room\*. Example: want to have a few drinks quietly in your room and you're underage? Knock yourself out. Get drunk and noisy and now I have to follow up on a noise complaint at 3am? Now you're getting written up.

Same rules apply here. Candles used in your room responsibly? Who cares, you are an adult. Set off your smoke alarm at 3am so that I have to door knock everyone's ass out of bed at 3am? You better believe that's a write up. Burning a bunch of candles in your window so that someone reports you? Also a write up (have to at that point because I no longer have plausible deniability if you later burn down your room). 

In short, I wouldn't risk it because there is no way to tell how close you are to setting off the smoke detector until it's too late (and 100% NO on incense, that will absolutely set it off).

I highly recommend scheduling a meeting with the professors. Best outcome is you'll get accommodations due to the fact English is your second language. Worst outcome is nothing changes. So, no harm done in talking to them.

Start the projects as early as you can. The earlier you start them, the earlier you can go to helproom if you need to, and the more likely helproom will be less busy. This will ultimately lead to getting more one-on-one time with a TA. 

When working on the projects, focus on one thing at a time. Focus on one loop or if statement at a time for now and eventually just focus on one function at a time. A lot of people try to code the entirety of the projects and then don't get why their code doesn't work. This will overwhelm you. Working bit-by-bit isolates where any problems can occur.

If you go down that path, check to make sure that course transfers 100% and gives you the exact credits or higher. (BS 161 is a 3 credit course, so wherever you take it  make sure that same community college course has the same credits or it can be higher like 4 credits).

Normally, I would it to your nearest community college where you live back home. However, there is a chance you may have to take it at another district (assuming you are from Michigan, I can't really speak from out of state.) because not every community college offers the same course. 

According to my academic advisor, anyone at MSU can take up to 60 community college credits to transfer back to MSU. It does not matter how many MSU credits you have. Yes, you can be a junior and still do community college credits. Just make sure don't transfer 61 or more credits from community college. Different university credits has no limits. This policy was implemented starting fall 2021.

Going back, I would recommend to anyone to take community college courses that you do not want to do at MSU.

The level of each project gets harder, but if start on time, and give enough time for going to the helproom when needed, you should be good.

As a non-native English speaker, it‚Äôll definitely be a challenge, but it‚Äôs absolutely doable. I would say to do these things (which aren‚Äôt so different from typical advice): 

1. Read any relevant textbook chapters ahead of lecture, and walk through ALL coding examples until you understand them. 
2. Write, on paper, in English preferably, but Chinese if that‚Äôs easier,  what you want your code to do. What are your inputs? What needs to happen to those inputs (multiply by 5, strip out vowels, etc)? What does the output need to be and look like? 
3. Translate that into pseudo code - on paper if you can, but on a computer if it‚Äôs easier. Write out ‚Äúx = 5. Y = 10. Z = user input. Function 1: multiply x and y, then prompt the user for Z and add it to the total.‚Äù 

^ Steps 2 and 3 need to be DONE the day the project is assigned. Not the next day, that day. 

4. Go to sleep. Don‚Äôt think about the project, don‚Äôt do any code unless you‚Äôre hit with a very sudden moment of clarity idea. 
5. The day after the project is assigned, get as much working code onscreen as you can. Maybe that‚Äôs just the variables, maybe that‚Äôs the entire project. If any single issue takes &gt;60 minutes, stop. Review the necessary chapter, and sleep. 
6. Repeat step 5 every day until the project is done, going into the office if you aren‚Äôt making progress.

First try to connect with people in your classroom(Sometimes people will not be friendly or likeable, especially during the first 2 semesters). Find people that take the same classes as you(As an introverted myself, I know that it is extremely hard to do the ""Do you want to be my friend"" talk, so disguise it as a ""study group"" or ""homework sharing group""). Try to connect with your floor neighbohrs(Some of them will be extremely reckless, so try to look for someone who you think will be friendly and talk to them whenever you see them on the hallsways; it doesn't have to be a 30 min talk, just a ""Oh I think we live on the same floor/hall"" followed by a ""what's your major"", ""what classes do you take""). Go to the gym, do some exercise, and get that dopamine boost(Sometimes you can find people playing ping-pong/basketball/volleyball, so try to join and you might get friends). For me it is extremely hard to do friends, but as long as you talk to somebody, there is the chance that they will become your friend. (I recommend you to think about how to start conversations because it is extremely uncomfortable to not know what to say in the middle of a conversation). Good luck, and don't give up.

But we certainly did have to bother them multiple times about the water, and I can only worry about how big of an issue it might be in the winter if these issues persist.

And I agree with your point about cheap college apartments generally. Some people definitely seem to complain a bit too much about cheap college apartments. The last apartment I was at in undergrad was pretty cheap ($500 a month including all utilities with 2 roommates in Raleigh) and had some pretty bad reviews. While it had some minor issues it was honestly great (only complaint would be thin walls and a meh dishwasher, which really isn‚Äôt that bad). So maybe I was just lucky then, but this did felt much rougher.

The main issue with the village was management and how they dealt with maintenance.

6490,"The person you are looking for is a psychiatrist or psychiatric-mental health nurse practitioner (MD, DO or PMHNP). They are typically the providers who handle the medication management for ADHD and other psychiatric conditions. But they will more than likely require an assessment from a psychologist (PhD or PsyD).

A family doctor (MD or DO) could diagnose ADHD and prescribe medication, assuming they have a DEA license to prescribe Schedule II drugs (e.g., opioids and stimulants). But it is unlikely they will do anything without a diagnosis from a psychologist first.

If you‚Äôre worried about insurance coverage and finding a provider, you can reach out to the Office for International Students and Scholars and they should be able to assist.

6491,"Yo, I have ADHD combined and I can tell you my experience, but it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs necessarily the care you will receive. Also, I‚Äôm not a doctor so obviously this isn‚Äôt actual medical advice.

I 100% knew I had ADHD since early high school. I also had tics (like Tourette‚Äôs). Problem was, my mother didn‚Äôt believe ADHD was a real thing so convincing her to get me assessed was not an option. Instead I developed coping skills that allowed me to get by. This helped me through college unmedicated. Not gonna act like I didn‚Äôt struggle with it at times, but I could manage to get by pretty well.

Well, my first year teaching came around and shit hit the fan. I could not manage myself, lesson planning, and 35 loud, constantly moving children from 8am to 4pm. My blood pressure hit 163 and I realized I needed help. I talked to my doctor about my ADHD struggles and that I hadn‚Äôt been diagnosed. I also mentioned being worried about amphetamines because research is drawing correlations to using this drugs and early onset dementia. My doctor then stated my choices were ‚Äúdie at 35 of a heart attack, or possible dementia at 50.‚Äù Kind of gruesome response, but 163 BP put me on heart attack watch at 23. Anyway, my doctor then referred me to a neuropsychologist who assessed me and said, ‚Äúlol you‚Äôre fucked. I know you have reservations about the drug, but I think it‚Äôd really help in these situations‚Äù so we negotiated to a child‚Äôs dosage of Adderall RX.

In my experience, doctors don‚Äôt like giving out ADHD diagnosis to college students because too many students are solely in it for the drug for whatever purpose they see (I need better grades, a quick buck, or a high). So they tend to push away these prescriptions. I only was acknowledged when I had reason to prove using this drug had more benefits than side effects. But again, this is my experience and yours may be different.

It‚Äôs worth mentioning that the drug is fucking expensive and not usually covered by insurance. When I first started taking it, I paid $35 a month. Then I switched insurances and the cost was $235 a month, but I was able to use that drug app (forget the name) to get it down to $75.

Lastly, I didn‚Äôt enjoy using the drug. It‚Äôs hard to understand the effects unless it‚Äôs in your system. In my case, I felt very tunnel visioned, zombified, it increased my anxiety and frustration, but also took away my appetite. This was on a child‚Äôs dose. 

I don‚Äôt take the drug anymore because I found balance in my work and outside life. But I wanted to share that it‚Äôs a big decision to make. It starts with a recommendation from your personal doctor to be assessed for ADHD by a neuropsychologist.",0.0694,0.3241,0.6065

I'm in the honors college, and I can't take the basic university reqs like IAH, ISS, ISP, etc. I need to take substitutions. I wrote down that I wanted to take an ISP course, but the advisor notified me that it wouldn't fill anything for me. I was only there just to see what I can do in the scenario that I don't get accepted to the business college and what plan of action I should take, but that random info really saved me.

You're right that PHY 221 and 222 feel weird, because they're formatted like other physics classes, rather than the lecture-heavy bio and chem classes we're used to. My advice would be to:

A. keep up with the reading, but don't worry about going through the whole derivations for each formula and the like. That extra info is ambrosia to physics majors, but we rarely use it. What matters is that you understand how a formula is used.

B. if the lack of lectures feels weird, or the readings feel too dense, try out Khan Academy or similar video lecture service. I logged onto there every time I didn't understand a concept when I was first taking these classes, and I managed a sweet 98%.

C. Don't get discouraged by the homework. It's made very difficult for a reason; these are essentially the toughest questions we can reasonably ask you. If you can nail the homework, then moving to the test will be like Forrest Gump taking off the leg bracers and realizing how fast he can run.

D. Talk to us! It sounds trite at this point, but our job is to help you. My office hours are in BPS room 1248 every Thursday from 5 to 7, if you want to talk to me in specific. The room almost always has at least one physics TA there, so even if you can't make any of the times that your TAs offer, you can pop over there and be helped regardless. Remember that our job as faculty is to make sure you understand things, and that we don't have an antagonistic relationship. It's *really* frustrating to see a student struggle in the course and just never seek any help, and especially frustrating to see someone call us losers or jerks for not being able to help them.

This is not bank credit or money credit, this is percentage points on your grade credit. This is not even legal. Rather than building and teaching an actual class, MSU has created a sports multimedia class that treats its students as indentured servants and the only way to pass the class is to dedicate several hours to work sporting events. Rather than offering paying jobs to students or alumni, they are requiring students to attend the events and work the events in order to pass the class. 

This is why the only jobs available are shitty restaurant jobs.

It‚Äôs a cheat code. Use it too much and it will destroy you, I know that, but when the times right I‚Äôll use that cheat code. I love popping an edible before a party, I love getting tipsy or drunk with a circle of friends. That‚Äôs the best part about these consumables, it‚Äôs almost the entire point. They truly do uplift social gatherings, it‚Äôs why people who refuse are unfortunately often excluded because they just don‚Äôt get it. It really shows. Many of them just aren‚Äôt the most fun to be with in those settings. 

Of course, like you, I feel the guilt too. Sometimes I wonder why I can‚Äôt just be happy and sociable like that all the time. Sometimes I think maybe there‚Äôs something wrong with me. Am I just feeling like a normal human when I‚Äôm intoxicated? Why can‚Äôt I just be normal? Maybe it would improve my life to be a little drunk or high everyday, but I‚Äôve seen what severe dependence looks like. That‚Äôs a path I will (hopefully) never tread. 

I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that ultimately, many of these things just don‚Äôt matter all too much. I try not to think about it. Yeah I purposefully drink to get tipsy during a social gathering. So what? I maintain a level of control, I know when too much is really *too much*. As long as your habits aren‚Äôt destroying you and more importantly, as long as YOU are happy or at least satisfied with your actions, there‚Äôs no harm done. 

I think people have better common sense than they think they do. Binge drinkers, deep down know they‚Äôre hurting and in extension, committing a ‚Äúbad‚Äù action.

I had previously gotten in (last year) but decided to take a gap year. I reapplied and somehow, someway my application was never reviewed so when decisions were supposed to come out I never got one. So I had to call up the ladder, asking where my decision was. I got passed off multiple times and had to call back several times to even get told they were sending out my decision. That never came so I had to go up the line again until I talked to an admissions director who was finally able to push it through.. That was not the end though. My finacial aid package also did not come by the promised date. Actually they waited weeks after I submitted my enrollment deposit to send me a blank package... Again had to call a bunch of people to get THAT sorted out. Then after signing the housing contact and hoping that everything was going to be amazing, they sent out an email to ALL transfer students saying they weren't allowed on campus housing and they had to find somewhere else (needless to say I had a week of panic attacks before they sent out an email saying it was a mistake). Things were settled and I finally got to campus.. Everything was great, people are nice finacial aid was figured out... 3 weeks in I get a student bill saying I owe $12000. Apparently because I had applied last year, decided not to come and then came this year as a transfer student (I took 3 cc classes of which none transfered.) their system 'glitched' and gave me freshman scholarships that I was never supposed to get and ""that the best the could offer was $12000 in loans ON TOP of the loans I'm already taking out"" so, now again I am fighting to get this fixed..

MSU is a great place. The campus is beautiful, the people are nice and overall I'm really enjoying it. But truthfully transfer students are not a priority. (I know a few other people have mentioned this) Admissions  makes transfer students feel unwelcome and forgotten.

Yes, technically this is correct, but it misses a huge factor, processed foods fuck with your hormones and energy.

Eventually your body will adapt to this new lower level or calories and your metabolism will decline, and you need to restrict calories even more AND you'll have less energy.

Focus on eating foods without nutrition labels (whole real foods: fruits, vegys, unprocessed meats etc) and you'll literally never have to count a calorie. Just eat to satiation and enjoy your gallons of energy.

7227,"My situation is different, although the emotions you‚Äôve mentioned are present with me as well. For the credibility of this post I won‚Äôt mention my grade, as this will cause my reasonings to be stereotyped. The reader can probably figure this out.

Having the time and energy to participate in  extra curricular activities while trying to maintain high academic standards in college is near impossible, and in fact, is a fraudulent propaganda. Whoever said you have time in college to pursue other relatively important tasks is a crook. For now, I‚Äôm participating in one official organization, though I would like to expand my knowledge and experience by joining others, the probability of achieving that is not possible considering, a two hour meeting hosted once per week can move a homework that is due tomorrow to stretch into 2am. If I can‚Äôt stay up any longer, then the homework snowballs into the next day distorting the original schedule. And once my sleep is obliterated, then I lack the braincells to take a midterm the next day. You can see where this is going.

Makes me wonder, ‚Äúam I the only one?‚Äù If not, then why can‚Äôt the person who is also a JMC students look the same as I? With dark baggy eyes, impaired breathing from tiredness, and absolutely disconnected nervous system occurring unintentionally when making public speeches.
It is possible to say there are people in similar situations, I don‚Äôt dismiss them, but I can‚Äôt seem to find anyone trying their very best to manage staying fit, practicing an instrument each day, attending academic activities along with hobbies (such as learning how to code) while earning the respect of faculty through academics. I could easily do this if homework was not assigned every next day‚Äîcreating a serious deal of diminishing returns. 
 

What I‚Äôve realized, if intentionally or not, the system creates the incentive to simply cheat and spare yourself a lot of time and effort. That is what I‚Äôm seeing.

Noting the comment by another redditor, mentioning half the college students as miserable, it may very well be True. Posing a questions: Is this right?

I'm 21M, a senior in zoology, and really fucked myself with untreated ADHD in my freshman and sophomore years, I attended a different school at the time though in Flint and had issues at home and staying there.

I ended up meeting a girl who went here and I ended up semi following her, semi just wanting to get out of my situation. We are also still together and will be celebrating 2 years together at the end of this month :)

I also feel as though I only have maybe two or three friends of my own, but I live at least an hour away from the closest one and they are all incredibly busy with their lives too. My only real friends here i've met through my girlfriend, and I just feel stagnant.

I broke down after applying to vet school this year because I understand that my odds are slim to none. I am not even sure that is what I would want to do with my life, and I feel like I can't make a living doing the things I truly love. Now I am considering doing a complete 180 and going back to trade school or to get an apprenticeship in carpentry or something like it. I don't have any network or real animal related jobs, just kind of high hopes on nothing. 

I agree that it's exceedingly melancholic, I have accepted very few positions that will get me pointed in a direction that I am wanting to go. I haven't really joined any organizations that have made me friends, and it's really my own fault. I only just go to work, maybe the gym if i'm not exhausted, and of course to school. 

It's been really nice in a sense to read your post because it has made me feel much less alone, even just knowing that someone else feels a similar way about regretting it all.

7429,"**MMG 421** - took this class first semester junior year. the professor still used a 1990s style [overhead projector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overhead_projector). he did post what i assume were photo scans of his overheads onto D2L. but man this was one of the most boring classes i remember having. it was similar to MMG 301 in the general learning loop, except we learned more about the lifestyles of the microbes (makes sense considering its literally physiology). i had this class at 1PM monday, wednesday, friday, and it didn't take me long to go from having a 1PM class three times a week to having a 1PM nap three times a week. the professor seemed like a really nice, older gentleman, but if i was gonna fall asleep during the class anyway, i stopped going. i 3.0d it

**MMG 431** - took this class the same semester as 421. this class ended up being the class i spent a majority of my energy with that semester. it was not easy. i enjoyed it, still - the content was interesting, i had good people in the class to work with, the professor was by no means bad at his job. but i remember having to really put time and effort into this class. this is the second class i look back on and really appreciate having (honestly, i'd love to take it again, just because i think i would be even more appreciative of it). i remember lots of crazy specific genetic mechanisms that you will probably only be able to learn by physically mapping them out yourself while marking and noting the mechanisms. definitely not an easy class, but at least it was an enjoyable class. i 3.0d it

**MMG 433** - after taking 431 the semester before, i was so excited for this class. it turned out poorly. first off, i did not actually know the difference between ""genetics"" and ""genomics"" at the time, so we spent way less time with specific mechanisms like in 431 and instead way more time with large scale, bioinformatic studies (which, to be fair, is literally what genomics is. unfortunately, i was not always the sharpest tool in the shed/was too lazy to care). it also doesn't help that the professor was the exact opposite of the 431 professor. this professor was sooooooo boring and he would just seemingly go on and on for an entire 2 hour class block. this was also the semester i discovered r/tinder, so i spent many class periods scrolling that and laughing at people's stupid dating app situations, rather than actually pay attention. the classroom was also crappy, too, honestly. MMG 431 was in MPS 1200, i believe, which felt like a very freshly built/renovated building with a more welcoming atmosphere. 433 was in the natural resources building, and was in a very very old classroom that was deteriorating. it doesn't sound like a lot, but, having taught in a few different classrooms, it really makes a difference. anyway, if you understand, and are fine with/appreciate that genomics will be more bioinformatics than actual genetics, you'd probably have a different experience. i 2.0d it

**MMG 451** - i took this first semester senior year. in my defense for MMG 404, this class ended up taking so much of my time. with that said, if you were to ask me what my favorite class i took at MSU was, there's a good chance that 451 will be my response - it's the third course that i am really glad i took and appreciate having taken it as i look back. i was fortunate to have a bunch of friends in the class (thanks to Briggs!) which i'm sure helped, but i found this class so interesting. i forget the professor's name, but she was so nice and always so willing to answer questions. the class was in a ""flipped classroom"" style, meaning that there were readings/videos/modules we were expected to work with outside of class, and then in class we would have weekly (usually the first class of the week) quizzes about said modules (we used a program called tophat). after the quiz, we would get some more content (generally more detail about whatever content/reading we had outside of class). sometimes, we would have time that day to start the week's work, which was usually some sort of work packet to build on the content we covered. the other class day of the week would continue with that work packet, talk about it as a class, maybe get more content. not a bad style, honestly. even though i wasn't great about staying up to date with the week's readings (shocker), i was still able to learn a decent amount during the class. with that said, 451 is also the class that resulted in me staying at a study hall (usually an empty classroom in holmes so we could use a whiteboard and draw out the mechanisms) until ungodly hours. and it was a common occurrence. similar to virology, though, i at least was really enjoying the content, so i didn't necessarily dread it. exams didn't feel as heavy because of the weekly work, but still a good portion of the class. on top of the course content, there was also a research article that would be shared, and we were expected to have read and understood the content of the paper (generally related to whatever mechanism/content we were learning). the first page of each exam was solely focused on that research paper, so it was absolutely necessary to have read it (for reference, there was a unit i was struggling with a bit more, so i spent a lot of time with content, but forgot about the article. i didn't answer a single question on that page of the exam because i was just straight up lost). i 3.0d it


well this definitely turned into something. i hope this helps in someway. i realize that i didn't get the chance to talk about any courses in the ""ecology, evolution, and behavioral biology"" section, but, to me at least, microbial eco and evolutionary paleobiology sound super intriguing, for what it's worth. i did some stalking and saw you asked about similar majors at some other schools, so it looks like you're thinking about post-secondary education. whatever route you end up going, i hope it works out for you. if you have other questions, please feel free to shoot me a DM!",0.4425,0.3236,0.2338
7430,"so i didn't major in Bio specifically, but i can still speak to a good handful of some of the classes in the requirement list.

first thing i'll say is that the [program course catalog](https://reg.msu.edu/academicprograms/ProgramDetail.aspx?Program=LBBIO1_BS1) says it's a Briggs major. i personally loved Briggs. it's a residential college, so all first-year Briggsies will live in Holmes Hall (it is kind of on the far east edge of campus, so it's a bit away from stuff like the football stadium or basketball arena, if those interest you). one of the things i really loved about being in Briggs is the smaller class sizes for things like the early year general sciences (so classes like chem 1 and 2, bio 1 and 2, etc.). it sounded like the university chem classes had like 300 people, whereas the Briggs chem classes had more like 120. a lot of the professors i had were really great about being available for office hours (especially because most of their offices were in Holmes Hall, too), and there are still numerous TAs that i've had great experiences with, too. Briggs also has its HPS (history, philosophy, and sociology of science) courses. if you're familiar, the idea is for them to be very similar to the Theory of Knowledge stuff that the IB curriculum focuses on. the purpose is to instill not only content knowledge, but also maintain and consider the humanity side of science, too. i personally didn't appreciate the classes at the time, but i'm thankful for them now

alright, well since i'm bored on a friday night you're gonna get a wall of text. i'm just gonna go class by class and compare the course list in the catalog with my experiences:

**CEM 251 and 252** - generally considered ""premed weeder classes,"" so also had some really big lectures. honestly, orgo is actually what really made me appreciate chemistry a lot more. lots of memorizing functional groups and how they react (there was always a ""synthesis"" question, where we had to draw out a hypothetical series of reactions in order to take a given molecule and turn it into the listed product - these were the dreaded questions). grades were very exam heavy. i think i 3.5d 251 and then 4.0d 252.

**BMB 401** - a lot of people take this class over the summer, where it's a lot of prerecorded lectures and memorizing, and then exams were actually taken at a high school a bit away (but i think we had the option to pick where we were taking them). dives waaaay deeper into a lot of common high school-taught process like the calvin and krebs cycles (e.g., i teach the calvin cycle in 3 steps when 401 teaches the full thing; i teach glycolysis in a 4 step process when it's actually a series of 11 enzyme catalyzed reactions). definitely not a class to take lightly, but not a class that you're destined to fail. very exam heavy grading. i 3.0d it while work a job and taking another class that same summer

**IBIO 341** - i took this class online the same summer as biochem, but also only as a single session (so half a semester). it sucked that way. i do not recommend it. i would imagine if i were physically present and able to work with the content i would have enjoyed it much more and also done much better in it (especially since it was my damn major lol). i feel like i remember driving to MSU for all of the exams that class. i 2.5d it

**MMG 301** - lots of memorization. honestly not a super hard course, but i took the class at the start of my ""what if i stopped paying attention in lecture"" phase, so i probably lost a lot. i also feel like if you put a little extra time in learning things like taxonomic classifications, it would help immensely. i still remember the general learning loop. professor would talk about some genus of bacteria, its physical characteristics, ways to identify it (such as being Gram negative or Gram positive), potentially pathogenic pathways, and then exam. if you actually put some time outside of class, i'd imagine this class becomes a breeze. i 2.5d it

**MMG 409** - ahhh, euk cell bio. this class kicked my ass, and honestly, i couldn't tell you why. i just looked at msugrades.com and it looks like about half of the students the semester i took it got a 3.0 or better. i was also in a HORRIBLE mental state my entire junior year, and i was working in a lab that i absolutely hated that year, too, so perhaps those had some variable. i would imagine, looking at the syllabus, that the class got super detailed with basic processes in terms of specific types of protein groups needed or used for one purpose or another. maybe someone else can provide some better insight. i did just go and find [this post from january of 2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/aegcpe/mmg_409_eukaryotic_cell_biology_with/) about it. i agree with the comment about trying to take notes during class - i just couldn't keep up. i 2.5d it

**IBIO 328** - i took this class my final semester at msu in the spring of 2019. i hated it. i did not find any interest in the content at all. my memory of the class was that lectures felt like talking about the different taxonomic classifications of fish that i did not care about and that's it. there was also an associated lab that was somewhat more interesting, but it was not easy. the lab worked more like the class title sounds. we dissected many organisms (specifically, i remember a lamphrey, a mudpuppy, a shark, and a cat), and had to  point out specific anatomical structures in those organisms. the final was a series of previously dissected samples with different parts of each marked, and us having to identify them. i did not do well in this class. i also had odd circumstances surrounding me taking it. i decided between the fall and spring semesters that year that i wanted to pursue education, and with all of my classes in my degree program i was so close to being certified for biology. i only needed a plant bio, an anatomy, and a physiology. IBIO 328 was the only anatomy course that both grad programs i was looking at would accept for their anatomy requirements, so i had to. and, again, second semester of senior year while also playing club sports, so i was probably not prioritizing as well as i should have. i barely passed with a 1.5

**FSC 440** - took this class my first semester senior year. it was an early morning class, so, in staying True to my poor schooling habits, i found myself skipping it more than i should have. i wish i could remember more about it, but i could probably count on two hands the amount of lectures i went to and still have fingers left over. i remember one of the large pieces for the grade was a research paper on a foodborne pathogen outbreak, but there were some stipulations. i think i ended up going with a salmonella outbreak? idk, i don't remember. i 2.5d it

**MMG 404** - took this my first semester senior year. i remember it well because i do not remember any of it. i met monday and wednesday mornings at 8:30 across the campus from where i lived. i went to the first week of lectures, and then started skipping, only attending for exams. bad idea. very similar to IBIO 341, i would bet big money that being able to actually talk about the content with the professor in class would have made a huge difference. instead i was left trying to teach myself, and i did not have the willpower to struggle through it. i remember the class size was small, though, so it definitely would have been useful to attend lecture. i 1.5d it

**MMG 413** - i took this the same semester i took euk cell bio. so, in my defense for euk cell bio, i had many classes this semester that i would not classify as easy. virology was one of them. i remember that there were weekly readings that we were supposed to do and work in small groups to answer a ""mini quiz"" of sorts. unfortunately, these readings were usually some sort of peer-reviewed article, and my reading comprehension for science journals was not a strong suit of mine at the time. the lecture content was super fascinating, though. we talked about many common viruses like influenza, HIV, and noroviruses, as well as more recent ""big news"" outbreaks (at the time, these were Zika and Ebola. i'd be shocked if there wasn't a full unit on COVID alone lol). i remember liking the professor. i didn't always feel like she was the greatest teacher, but i thought she did well at breaking down the content into terms that upperclass level geneticists could better digest. there are 3 classes that i look back on and remember appreciating the most, and viro is one of them. i 3.0d it

7730,"Hey u/seaside I'm not an MSU student ...I'm a dad of an MSU student and am often on the employer side of job fairs, including 1 on 1. Here's my take:

Job fairs are there to help students looking for internships and jobs with employers (like me) looking for interns/full time hires. So a students goal is typically either to find a job (internship or full time) or to figure out what's available in order to prepare for a later job search.

so when you're there, what you want to do is figure out which companies seem like a good match for you. They're doing work you think might be interesting, have a good culture, and  hiring students with your background. 

The 1 on 1's are kinda like speed-dating. They're not interviews..there isn't time. You just want to learn a bit more about them to make sure you want to work for them and you want them to say ""hey, u/seaside is cool and we should set up an interview."" 

So yeah, having a resume handy is good. Be ready to introduce yourself and talk to you skills and interests. By that I mean, be ready to say ""I'm studying x and y and I would like to work in a field where I can do z kinda work"".  

The company should do the same, the company rep should tell you about the company, about their work culture, and examples of projects or work efforts the company has done. They're trying to sell you to. Feel free to ask the company questions that you want info about. 

If all goes well, the company will get your info and reach out to set up an interview later (which you can ignore or cancel if you're not interested).

At the end hopefully you'll have a much better idea about some companies are hiring in your areas of interest and some possible job opportunities through either dropping off your resume or the 1 on 1.

Definitely helps with applying the concepts, if that helps you learn better. Plus, you have immediate access to the ULAs/TAs as your working through with your group to help guide you. The biggest thing, obviously, is that you have to learn outside of class since there aren't traditional lectures.

If you'd prefer just attending lectures and doing practice problems on your own, then the lecture-based course would probably be what you're looking for.

The place is so cool and the finishing is great, everything is new, maintenance great always on time.. BUT

if money is something concerns you don‚Äôt live here, last spring my AVERAGE utilities bill was around 90-100$ per person even though I live in a 4b apartment. The walls inside the apartment is super thin and can hear your roommates, but super thick for the apartment next to you. I don‚Äôt have a car so it was a hustle for me to go to classes since bus 1 is not reliable and usually take a long time + it‚Äôs route just by the edges of the campus, doesn‚Äôt worth waiting for it. You might consider walking to Brody ~9min walking to there and take a bus from there (20,25,31,34). I see many ppl complaining about the parking lot because it‚Äôs really kind of far for everyday use. You can‚Äôt park near the leasing office because it‚Äôs for the BuSiNeSS guests. The club house is a big lie, the coffee machine doesn‚Äôt work most of the time, and the place get locked automatically around 11 so you can‚Äôt enter it and hangout with friends. 


So: if money something doesn‚Äôt concern you + walking to brody to take a bus or walking to the parking lot is something you‚Äôre fine with during the winter. I don‚Äôt see other cons that would stop you from living here.

P.s. besides the high utilities bill, they are throwing the water bill on us starting from next fall (they say it‚Äôs around $10)

In my 30s, I feel much happier. 

If you don't like it, don't feel pressured to socialize at all. I can only handle one close friend at a time - i never had a group - just 2- 3 close friends at different times in life. Sometimes not even that.

Internships are hard to get into - jobs are much easier if you are qualified. I have never had any  issues finding or keeping a job. I didn't have a stellar GPA or social skills  -so you are already better than me. Met my husband at work - now he's my whole social circle.

I would suggest to go to meetups to socialize. It is low commitment, you can do some fun activity and you never have see those people again in case you embarrass yourself or offend anyone. 

Finding meaning/happiness: if you aren't passionate for your work, you can still be happy. Just do what is expected of you at work and have hobbies to be fulfilled. You can find religion/spirituality or hell become a superfan of some TV/movie/Sport or whatever. There are so many things in life to make one happy. I have a list of 100+ things to do make yourself happy. I have had a pretty tragic life but I've never been depressed or in therapy. 

Don't ever think your life has to be a certain way to be happy. To repeat the cliche- happiness is a choice. 

It is completely OK to be alone as long as you don't feel lonely. I have travelled solo and I often go to movies and eat alone. It is nice not to be dragged around by others. Being alone, I can always have my way and do what I want to do. I am pretty happy - only times I've felt sad is when other are condescending to me thinking I could not possibly be happy.

The more you challenge yourself and grow in undergrad the easier scoring highly on the MCAT and passing board exams becomes. If you are serious about pursing medicine, don't treat undergrad like a joke- actually learn stuff that will pertain to your future. I personally did the Physiology major in the college of natural science (which was designed for people wanting to pursue medicine) and it has been soooo valuable to my success so far.

The only thing you absolutely need to have on your application extracurricular wise is at least a few hundred hours of clinical exposure, this can come from volunteer or employed opportunities. 

My most important experiences included being an ED scribe for two years, hospital volunteer x3 year, volunteer coordinator at said hospital, ambassador for my undergraduate program, over 1000 hours as a RA in two labs, and being a basketball and girls on the run coach. These things allowed me to really say that I had exposure to medicine and genuinely enjoyed it.

Know that if you choose something like chemistry or biochemistry that you'll have to take upper level science courses like pchem that are beyond the scope that is needed for medicine. Make sure you really enjoy these subjects if you're going to pick these majors as they are quite difficult. I graduated from MSU and am currently a medical student and majored in neuroscience. I feel like a lot of my undergraduate classes had transferable knowledge to medical school and I felt well prepared for the MCAT; plus I just enjoyed the upper level classes and did really well in them.

I got my research assistantship by networking. I studied horticulture, which is a small program nationwide so people are pretty accessible. Not sure if it is the same for biology, but reaching out to a particular professor who is working on something you are interested in is a great way to start. Your qualifications sound great to me! But I don't know what integrated biology wants or needs from you. Admission requirements vary wildly between programs. 

Your advisor (ie. The professor who will be overseeing your research) is essentially your boss (if you want to think of it as a job). It's good to get a feel for how they manage people/time/assignments before you think about applying. Basically when I connected with my advisor, he asked me to apply (and essentially said I would be accepted). If it is a more competitive program it may not be the same. Ask if they have minimum standards, and don't forget to take the GRE! 

It will definitely feel weird reaching out. And that is OK! Worst case it is a networking opportunity, and if they don't like you/don't accept you move on to the next one. It's great to get your name out there in general... And who knows, maybe you will see them at a conference and they will wish they had accepted you! :)

 But yeah, at least with the student loans unsubsidized loans will gain interest while your student is in school. Subsidized won't gain interest until they're out of school. For each, I believe they have 6 months after graduation to get a job and start paying. It's also worth noting they can start paying off interest for those  while you're in school without having to start paying off the loan itself, so all that interest doesn't start piling up for it. 

I'm not exactly sure how the parent PLUS loan works, I know they gain interest but I don't know when you guys start being on the hook for paying.

8443,"I'll take a crack at it sure,

1. You kind of are, it's based on your FAFSA information. Government loans (subsidized / unsubsidized / PLUS) are all based on your FAFSA information. If you're dependent on your parents, which you probably are, it's completely based off their income. Some kids won't get offered government loans, but this is usually because they didn't turn in their FAFSAs or their parents are crazy rich. You will need to accept both subsidized and unsubsidized loans through MSU's finaid portal (found in SIS) before you get your bill. This portal's been pretty buggy for the last few years, so make sure you keep an eye out and make sure your finaid loans are showing up on your billing statement, also found in SIS. 
2. You cannot gain any more government FAFSA loans than what you're offered. If you lose a scholarship you may be offered more and if you gain a scholarship you may be offered less. Besides situations considered abysmal to you and your family (loss of a job, maybe death of a parent) this is the only way to get that changed. And no, it's not worth losing a scholarship over. However, for a dependant student, a parent can take out a PLUS loan through the government in the same portal. This is different than the subsidized/unsubsidized loans since they are in the parent's name and they are the parents responsiblity and not the students. If you're an independant for some reason or your parents credit score is low enough that they cannot be offered a PLUS loan, you'll get the same offer but in your name. Any PLUS loan can cover the rest of the estimated costs of living, which is likely more than what just tuition and housing are. If your parents refuse to take out a plus loan then you either need to come up with the money yourself or go private. 
3. I'm in a situation where I'm working to cover the rest of my expenses because I don't even want to touch private loan companies. I wish you the best. 
4. Private loan company. Pretty sure anyone can qualify. I've heard very, very mixed reviews so make sure you talk to people in similar situations before you go through with them.
5. As I mentioned while explaining PLUS loans, your estimated cost of living will be higher than tuition. Any excess loans you take out will come back to you either in a lump-sum or the form of a monthly check (it might be only monthly check though, I don't do my finances this way). You can use that check for whatever you see fit AFAIK, including rent.",0.075,0.4414,0.4836
8444,"Thank you. It doesn't look like we will ever get an overage in the initial loan offer, so no overage available for apartments. We will have to go the Parent Plus route.

5. If the loans &gt; the cost of the school you get a refund. For example, if you borrow $10,000 and school cost $8000 the school will send you a check for $2000. This is how it works for federal loans, if you do it privately then you might just need to borrow directly for that need, not sure how that works. 


As a parent, if you qualify for parent plus (credit score etc. that is the route I would go **if** you trust your student to repay their loans. Becuase a parent plus loan is a student loan taken out in the **parents** name. So if your student doesn‚Äôt pay, you‚Äôre on the hook.

Suite style cons: you have to clean it yourself, share it with 3 other people, might be occupied when you want to use restroom/shower. Community bathroom pros: almost always will have an open shower/toilet, gets cleaned by cleaning staff.

Edit: There are comments below mine that seem to indicate that MSU has been raising their admissions standards.

My hope is for readers to use this text both for its practical value and for their healing journeys. Broadly, this work is intended to support tangible forms of accountability for those who make higher education settings unsafe through their misconduct, abuse, willful indifference and enabling.

If you want to do the research-based master's, you'll need to find a faculty member to do research with, but there's a chance they'll be able to pay you out of their research funds. To go that direction, you'll probably need to reach out to individual professors who are doing research you're interested in.  


If you want to do the course-based master's your main funding option is going to be through TA'ing. It's possible (but a little more challenging) to get admitted with guaranteed TA funding. If you don't get admitted with guaranteed funding, there is a chance you won't have funding in a given semester.

Uhm, I believe when you take the risk and park there without a permit, it literally says you'll get ticketed if caught. 2 months without a ticket is honestly way farther than you should've gone. Play stupid games win stupid prizes.

You do know that many parking enforcers ARE students? Just like you they're trying to do their job. Its not their fault if you get caught.

* you‚Äôre talking about something you don‚Äôt have a full grasp of.

If you didn't know, many campus parking spots are reserved for faculty. They are used as incentives for tenured employees. While they are theoretically empty, I cant imagine a Spartys employee needs one when they're working a few hours a week compared to a salaried staff member. Also, you can buy one, but it costs $1000+. Its not ""I can park here for my job"" -- you literally ""own"" the spot for a time.

* I have a heart condition that makes it so I can't bike to work

Are you not able to use public transit? The bus system is free, reliable and relatively fast. I rely on it to get to and from work, or I walk. I have to plan around my 2 campus jobs, but my coworkers and supervisors are very understanding. If you cant accomodate transit time, you need to change around your schedule or talk with your boss.

Cough could be allergies, residual issues from having covid or a bad cold (my roommate freshmen year had this awful cough after she got really sick that lasted years and they had no idea why). Or if they are a smoker.

Im sure there are a lot of things it could be, or it could literally be nothing and just result of being stressed, in a different environment and getting used to the weather. Only way to know is to SEE A DOCTOR. Im pretty sure students have 3 appointments at Olin they can go to.

MSU's football has had issues in the past with getting into fights - both at frat parties and that one major Rather Hall incident that happened where 10 players were ""caught"" beating the shit out of frat members, Rather Hall residents and the front desk worker over some ex-girlfriend. (All within the last 15yrs)

Sure, those didn't happen ""within a stadium"" or ""in the last three years"" - but the fact of the matter is, why the fuck are these football players allowed to beat the shit out of people and only get suspended - not expelled, fined, and charged.

Because they are protected by MSU's athletic department and the money it brings in.

If anyone else 10 v 1 someone and beat the shit out someone -- even if they were provoked (cause that seems to be the excuse (oh he was skipping by after he talked shit earlier.) -- they would've been thrown in jail atm. All we got is some lame ass statements and four suspensions.

1. Review the syllabus and plan out the entire semester.  Budget time for all quizzes, tests papers and exams.  Don‚Äôt let anything sneak up on you.  

2. Attend classes, take detailed notes and read all required books.  After the first exam you get to know the prof‚Äôs tendencies as far as where they draw info from (class lectures versus books).  So, you should be more efficient on studying for subsequent exams.

3.  If you get a bad score on a paper/ quiz/ exam get pissed.  But use your anger as motivation to figure out what you missed and adjust your study process.  

4. If you find that you lack skills in certain areas (reading/ writing/ note taking) get some help in the off season.  Take a writing class.  Take an exam prep or college studying class.

5. Take time to pat yourself on the back.  You are at a Big Ten University.  There are lot of people that will never achieve that academic accomplishment.  From where you sit in East Lansing, people have gone on to become billionaires, CEOs  of fortune 500 companies, contributed to Nobel prizes, advised world leaders and many other significant achievements.  

6. Have fun.  Dedicate a day or two each week to experience East Lansing.  Go to house parties.  Do stupid stuff.  Attend some bball games.  

7.  Finish each week and take an inventory of how well you accomplished your goals.

9520,"Hi, so as someone in the advanced track program I may be able to help.  I can't confirm if the course will be accounted the major requirement so you would have to check with a ChemEng advisor. However, if you want to take the course it has listed prereqs of MTH 309 or MTH 317H and MTH 133.  309 is linear algebra and 317H is the honors version. 309 is often taken with another class MTH 299, transitions, while 317H is both of them combined (to my understanding, I'm currently taking 317H).  Most people in 347H are coming from 317H (I would assume not 100% sure). If you want to take 347H I recommend talking to Tsvetanka Sendova. She is one of the advanced track advisors and the H-level math courses require manual overrides to enroll. Even if you haven't taken 309 or 317H (which I'm assuming you haven't as a ChemEgr, but I could be wrong) still reach out to her or just stop by her office.

And if you are applying to grad school (like me) then it would still be a case by case basis on if it‚Äôs even worth it to retake.

Honestly I'm not sure I can think of anyone I know in college that hasn't. College can be such a big and jarring change, especially if you are used to having academic success in other settings. It sounds like you are a very hard worker, you wouldn't have gotten this far if you weren't. It's completely ok not to be at your 100% best at all times, you're a human. When I am having low points I try look back at all the times before when I thought I wouldn't be able to get back on track with something but every time I did. I have truly had moments where I thought I wouldn't be able to finish my degree and it seemed like all the odds were against me but after I took some time to recover and regroup I was able to find a way. It may not have worked out how I expected but if you can try to believe and trust in yourself even just a tiny bit that you will be able to figure out what ever happens it can give you the little hope you need to keep going and take off some pressure you might feel to push yourself in a linear path of success. Ups and downs are inevitable unfortunately but the good thing is that that means it won't be like this forever even if it may feel like it right now. I know all of that optimistic stuff can feel unhelpful in the really dark moments so if nothing else I hope you can try not to be too hard on yourself. 

It can be more helpful than you might think too to try and set aside a chunk of time each day to only focus on doing something you enjoy. For me I try to take daily walks and listen to podcasts/music I like but anything you enjoy is worth doing.

Traditionally I believe the budgeted time consumed each week per credit hour averages 3 hours. 22 credit hours is equivalent to roughly 66 hours of work in your courses each week. However, as we all know there are courses that demand a premium on those budgeted hours. I think back to a few of my philosophy courses which required reading hundreds to thousands of textbook excerpts a week on top of weekly essays and workshops. That 4 credit hour course ate up nearly 25-30 hours of my week. If you got yourself into a mess like that with courses averaging close to 7 hours of work per credit hour you would be looking at 150+ hours of classwork for your 22 credit hour schedule. That's nearly every waking moment of the week spent on your classes.",0.0578,0.3779,0.5643

9769,"Hi, I‚Äôm also a freshman and was confused about somethings so I‚Äôll include them in case you are too:

1. Your ‚Äúenrollment date‚Äù means the day and time when you can begin enrolling in classes. Mine was like 11/1 at 11am. I didn‚Äôt realize this and just enrolled yesterday, when I could‚Äôve days ago. I also don‚Äôt remember seeing an email, but if you go into your SIS account under ‚Äúclasses‚Äù, then click ‚Äúenrollment dates‚Äù and you can see when you can start enrolling. It‚Äôll say like ‚Äúenrollment appointment begins‚Äù.

2. Like others have said, advisors will not reach out to you for you to enroll in classes. You can make an appointment with them in the SIS account, under ‚Äúacademic progress‚Äù under ‚Äúadvising/tutoring appointments‚Äù. Click create new appointment at the top then the subcategories to choose the right advisor, then eventually an appointment day by clicking ‚Äúnext days‚Äù. If ‚Äúnext days‚Äù doesn‚Äôt show up, none are available and try to check back in the early morning (My best times for viewing availability was like 4am ish). 

3. Also like others have said, look at your graduation requirements. You can see these also in ‚Äúacademic progress‚Äù, under a few different tabs. If you‚Äôre in something like Lyman Briggs or James Madison, or the honors college, make sure to also look for their requirements. The HC requires you to take substitutions so if you‚Äôre apart of it, you‚Äôd benefit from meeting with an HC advisor as well.

Deeper than that I think the general ‚Äúdislike‚Äù, at least on the MSU side, comes from the fact that most of us grew up being told by our UM-fan peers how much more elite UM is than MSU. Many UM students and alumni will admit and brag that UM has a competitive and elitist culture, which is contrary to the less-competitive communal culture found at MSU. I attended Purdue for the first part of my graduate studies, which ranked higher than UM in my program, but I was still somehow belittled for it by my UM peers, whereas I never heard anything but congratulations from my Spartan counterparts. UM is a great university and their culture is understandable, it‚Äôs just different than MSU‚Äôs.

Furthermore, we‚Äôve all watched Jim Harbaugh and his supporters refuse to take responsibility for anything ever. Even during the recent Penn State incident, UM coaches were placing the entirety of the blame on Penn State without any acknowledgement of how their players could have contributed.

Hell, I've seen some halls not even open stations for meals because they still do not have employees to serve! If they don't have employees to serve, how are they going to manage to find employees to clean. Plus, students are fairly picky. If they want to work they are going to want to scan cards or serve others. Not clean others dishes. I'm certain that plastics cost the dining halls more than the labor would. Its an instance of 'if they could, they would' but without the labor to have the areas open, they most certainly don't have the labor to wash the dishes.  Finally, to mention your temp agency point, the city of Lansing is relatively small in the state (4th or 5th largest?) and MSU isn't the only place that needs the temp employees. I doubt there are enough physical people to work at MSU, while competing with all of the other businesses desperate for help as well, without the student employment.

Stafford loans for all, regardless of financial need. Students could simply borrow their spending money now instead of working for it. And boy do they! You can hardly find students looking to work for a wage any more. What you get instead are part time employees. Locals who cannot manage to make it as full time adults and Department of Health and Human Services projects. Good luck with that silverware sorting. Until the cost of attending MSU catches up with inflation (and it will, Let's Go Brandon), students will not have to work to make ends meet and the lack of labor will continue to plague MSU's residential dining facilities.

I already looked at their website and saw one complex on their website that was a 1 bedroom, pet friendly, and 760 a month. So I called and they confirmed the rent price and said it was still available and to come in a tour. 

When I went to do the tour I told them exactly what complex I wanted to tour and they asked my budget and said it was over my budget and that they would show me other apartments in my budget first. They wouldn‚Äôt take no for an answer so I said fine as long as they are pet friendly. 

The first one they took me to wasn‚Äôt pet friendly. I asked why they would show me a non-pet friendly apartment when I have a dog and they said ‚Äúwell you can just lie and say it‚Äôs a service dog and there is registries online‚Äù like wtf‚Ä¶that‚Äôs illegal‚Ä¶

So then he shows me another one that is $1,100 so I ask why he showed me this one that is over budget when the one I want to see is apparently ‚Äúover budget‚Äù too (even though it wasn‚Äôt) and he said he thinks he can offer me a deal of $950 (still 150 over my budget). 

Then the 3rd one he shows me is again not pet friendly and I again ask why he‚Äôd show me an unpetfriendly apartment and he was like ‚Äúoh shit I forgot you have a dog‚Äù as if it wasn‚Äôt the problem we had 20 minutes ago. 

So then at this point I ask ‚Äúok when are we going to see the apartment I actually want to see‚Äù and he  says he doesn‚Äôt have time as most tours only show 3 units so I will have to call back to schedule another tour‚Ä¶.i left and ended up finding a different company. 


The most uncomfortable part of the tour was that they just go into occupied units with no prior warning. The 2nd apartment he showed me was a scramble because he needed to show me something dog friendly so he literally just walked up to a unit and knocked and then walked in with zero prior warning. The 3rd one he called on the way there to give people a 5 minute heads up that we were coming. And the units were so dirty and filthy that it didn‚Äôt make me want to rent there more because I couldn‚Äôt picture myself living there.

Second, this is how they did it last year: first people who were already in a single and planning on staying on one the next year were able to fill out a form to keep their spots. I'm unsure if this has already happened for 23-24. A few months later, an interest form went out for current 2nd and 3rd years asking for their interest in a single dorm. They then told everyone that the singles were completely full and there would be no room, but then I believe around March yet another form went out for 1st years. (Although if anyone remembers better you can correct me on dates and who gor what form lol).

I say 1st years because that included transfer students, and at least from my experience it *seems* like they favored people with more credits so those guys are gonna get times to choose their room first. (I transferred as a junior but still counted as a first year last year, and I got very first pick of the remaining rooms). 

And very, very last - if there are any rooms left (keep in mind singles are Owen, which is about 1/10 hotel, and a few room across buildings in North) then current freshmen will get pulled from a hat for what sign up times / amount of rooms remain.

Tldr, yes you can have a single as a sophomore, but if they're doing it like they've been doing it then you either have to be reallllllyyy lucky or disabled and kind of lucky. 

I'll also say though it's pretty likely that this'll change. Housing has been a mess since COVID and the two year requirement + way over admission is pushing the upper classmen off of campus so keep an eye on it.

I was shocked when my roommate and her friends asked me about my sex life jokingly (they were discussing theirs too) when i had just moved in and we were getting to know eachother, using language like ""d*mn girl how many h*es you got?"" and it took some getting used to.
Sometimes I feel like it can also just depend on the person maybe, and we're used to telling who's more uptight vs more 'casual' based on cultural cues in our home country but don't know how to tell yet in American culture.",0.0444,0.3653,0.5903

The joke you told, I wouldn't be surprised if that led to the person holding a grudge against you or even a fight in some situations. Basically if you are going to talk like that in American society, you need to be VERY sure of yourself. You'll probably be viewed as rude or unstable. It sounds like your home country has a level of understanding that direct insults like that are jokes, and the US doesn't have that unless among close friends.

Swearing about stuff: just fine. Searing about other people: just fine (""those fuckers don't know shit""). Swearing indirectly at someone (""the fuck you say?""/""you've got to be shitting me"") usually ok if clearly joking, pretty questionable otherwise. Swearing at someone is damn near fighting words. You need to be clearly joking and/or insanely close friends.

What would pass for banter in much of the world would be perceived as and invitation to step outside and fight or a friendship ending argument here.

Also, calling someone a pussy here is more serious than you probably thought.

This is hard to explain, but Americans (generally, especially in the Midwest (i.e. Michigan)) value earnestness/goodwill/openess a lot more than other places. So while there is a lot of swearing, there isnt a lot of swearing at people or insult humor (except for between v close friends).

Say you're hanging out or at a club sport practice. Any swearing directed towards a person is a no, but saying ""fuck yeah"" after a good move or ""let's fucking do this"" before a hard drill is likely fine. Swearing to pump up or encourage, vs to tear down.",0.1222,0.3881,0.4897

As a guy, you‚Äôre only rude to people you know personally, then it can become a way of showing affection, similar to many other countries.

Honestly, I found it pretty difficult for a 100 level. In the summer, the course was accelerated (about 8 weeks) and I struggled with that pace. I'm also not particularly skilled in any element of game design (art, programming, etc), so if you are it would probably make the course much easier. I've heard the class is way more fun and more helpful to take in person. Personally, I didn't really think it was worth it to take it online.

Whether or not you can manage it depends on other factors. I definitely wouldn't recommend anyone at 17 credits take it if it's the accelerated 8 week online version of the class. In any case, If you're serious about game design, do it. A lot of game classes require this as a prerequisite, and you can be pretty creative with the projects you do if you are passionate about it. 

You can always give it a shot. If it feels like too much, you can always drop the course early on with no penalty :)",0.4829,0.3803,0.1368

What is your major? 
Why are you working in those labs? 
Those labs that are you already in, how long are you planning on staying them? 
Do you believe if you gain more experience in those projects/labs, would it help you better? 

So if you want to gain experience through those labs for your grad school application etc., as someone 
who worked around 4 labs in their undergrad, I believe  being in more labs at the same time would do you bad than good. Usually research needs time to read papers, work on your techniques etc. Even though your active work in those labs are limited to a few hours you can read some papers to extend your research or ask other people in the lab if you can also work with them. Instead of spending 12 hours in 3 different places where you would not be able to show your full potential because you are a human!! you can spend that time in one project where you have ins and outs in everything you did. It helps you better on interviews for grad school. Usually they care more about the quality than quantitiy",0.2161,0.4844,0.2995

They run for about $100 - $200

Any particle concentration within a certain size range would show up on a particulate matter detector, including mold. (e.g. PM2.5, PM10).  In certain readings, that matter is considered unacceptable for human life by the World Health Organization, though this level usually has to be quite high (e.g. heavy chain smoking), and you would almost certainly be able to pinpoint an area or source where things ""feel worse to breathe"" even without one.

Some people have pretty severe allergies to particulate matter in dust or in general odors, which gets exasperated in the winter because of less air being exchanged.  My uncle is one of them, and it turned out he needed injections to improve the antibodies that his mast cells produce in order to reduce this allergy.

Overall though I think what the others have said here is probably correct: Covid, Influenza, etc are all running quite rampant this year.  Without being able to isolate the air you breathe and the things you touch more, that's something you'll have to live with in a dorm.  Best stay warm, increase vitamin D, get lots of sleep, wash hands for DLU.  Even wearing a mask (which I know sucks, though they do work for Covid).  Myself with good masking/isolation I haven't been sick in nearly 3 years, though that level of isolation does come at great personal/human cost, especially for someone at your age, and its something most people wouldn't ever willingly put themselves through üòâ

&amp;#x200B;

I'll take you through the generic order of courses, ignoring gen eds like math, physics, bio or chem, etc. All the 200/300 levels I mention are required to take, and some of them have pre-requisites of earlier CSE classes.

&amp;#x200B;

First, you take the weeder classes, CSE 231 and 232. Introduction to programming in python and C++ respectively. Easy classes that are made difficult by the professors to make you want to quit, but if you look past all the weird bs in those classes, they are actually quite simple.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, you take CSE 260. This is discrete structures in computer science, I believe this class is mostly useless, but you do start learning some interesting topics like time complexity analysis. This class is basically an introduction to the mathematical theory behind computer science. (It's also the only one like this that you have to take). The 200-level CSE classes are quite annoying, but once you get passed them, it's honestly only up from there.

&amp;#x200B;

There's CSE 300 somewhere in here, a 1 credit class that teaches you the ethics of computer science. I didn't need to take it, because it's really new, but I've heard it's easy. You read some things, you write somethings, you learn what is the good and bad of computer science.

&amp;#x200B;

Next, CSE 320, a class that goes into the lower levels of computer science. This is where you learn to code in assembly and learn circuits for computers. If you aren't interested in something like this, then it's kind of difficult class to get through, but keep your mind open, I thought it was stupid at first, but I did come to enjoy some of it, even though I knew I would never need any of this information.

&amp;#x200B;

Next is CSE 325, this is a class about computer hardware and networking. Similar to 320 in the way, where if you are just here for coding, might be hard to get through, but can still be interesting regardless. This is where you learn how computers interact with each other, how HTTP protocols and wifi work, and information of that nature.

&amp;#x200B;

The last two (and I believe the two most important classes so far), are CSE 331 and CSE 335. Algorithms and data structures, and object-oriented software development respectively. 

&amp;#x200B;

CSE 331 is the class that teaches you basically how to ace a coding interview. You learn about lists, linked lists, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and all algorithms involved with those data structures and coding techniques. There's more to it, but it's a wonderfully important, fun, (although somewhat difficult) class.

&amp;#x200B;

Then there's CSE 335. This class is incredibly important, but also incredibly difficult for some. This is likely going to be the first class where you are learning how to code something in more than one file. You learn strategies of object-oriented programming, including how to design solutions as well as how to program solutions. The professor holds your hand through a majority of the course, as a lot of the ideas and solutions can be quite difficult, but he does make you do some things on your own, but it's never something new, it's always something you've done, just need to change a few things to make it work for a new thing. There are team projects, where you learn how to work in groups using project management ideas and GIT, and you learn so much in this class that is important to a programming career, although you learn most of it at a very high level, so not very in-depth.

&amp;#x200B;

Next, you choose 5 400 level classes, you can find them here, you can also find more information about requirements here as well: [https://www.egr.msu.edu/sites/default/files/ugs/MSU\_CoEngr\_CSE.pdf](https://www.egr.msu.edu/sites/default/files/ugs/MSU_CoEngr_CSE.pdf). These classes are the opposite of the 200 level classes. Difficult, but made easy. They understand that you are interested in the topic but not stressing yourself out over it, so it's good to learn while also getting good practice through homework and exams. (This comment doesn't apply to all, some are still very difficult classes, but for the most part, they aren't too hard)

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, you take CSE 498. The capstone of computer science, this is where everything you've learned is applied. There is a lot of hatred towards this class, as the professor is so annoyingly strict and has the weirdest requirements. But, for the most part, this class is you working with a team of students, for a company such as Auto-Owner's, Amazon, Meijer, etc. making a simple project for them from scratch. You go through all the steps, designing the solution, making it, prototyping it, etc. And you present on it at the end of the semester. This is a good class to possibly get your foot in the door at the company you do the project with, but it is a very annoying class to deal with outside of that.

&amp;#x200B;

That is the CSE department for the most part, there's obviously so much more I can tell you, and I sent you a dm for that exact reason, to go over much more specifics with you. I have three more suggestions for you, and anyone else reading this.

&amp;#x200B;

1) GET INTERNSHIPS, they are SO important to get a job after college, try to start either freshman or sophomore year. They get you an easy offer with a company once you graduate as well as good pay.

&amp;#x200B;

2) [https://msugrades.com/](https://msugrades.com/), when signing up for classes, look up the classes and professors on this website. This will tell you everything you need to know about what you're getting yourself into with a certain class or professor.

&amp;#x200B;

3) Join the MSU CSE discord, I think someone linked it already. It's super helpful, there are a ton of students and grads in that discord that can help you if you're stuck on assignments, looking for jobs, need help with resume stuff, or pretty much anything you might need.

&amp;#x200B;

I am happy to help you more, but I think I've definitely written enough, so dm me if you want more information. Hopefully you make the best choice for you, but I think when it comes to college, pretty much wherever you go, you'll be happy and get a job.",0.36,0.4015,0.2385
11135,"I wouldn't exactly classify the classes Nahum teaches as ""hard"". In fact, I wouldn't exactly know how to classify it. They're usually fairly easy classes, let's take 232 for example.

&amp;#x200B;

Very simple class, takes you through the basics of C++, similar to what we did in 231, just a different language. The problem comes from the expectations and unfairly expected edge cases. You could work for 8 hours on a project, have it working perfectly, and then when you run the test cases, you get like 50% because of random whitespace before the inputs. This is understandable, so you trim the spaces, and same thing because now it's not ""spaces"", it's ""tabs"". So you do that again, and now you get to 75% because the remaining test cases have extra spaces and tabs in between words. Remove this garbage and the projects are actually fairly ok.

&amp;#x200B;

The actual learning is hard too, as it is a very large class, so you don't get enough attention as an individual student. The TAs either don't care enough to help or are not allowed to help as much as they should be (considering you have non-cse majors taking this class).

&amp;#x200B;

And the exams, oh boy the exams. This is the only cse exam I've ever done bad on, and I'm a semester away from graduating. You could study everything you need to know for this class, but if you don't know the color of one of the professor or TA's dog, good luck! You might also need to memorize errors that you would get if you make a very specific mistake, however if you never make that mistake, you'll never know it exists. So good luck there too!

&amp;#x200B;

CSE 231 and 232 are exactly what they are meant to be. Weeder classes. They do not represent the cse department in terms of expectations or difficulty, so if you choose MSU, don't let it push you out. I'm going to go over some more general stuff in a different post, but I wanted to specifically respond about Nahum here.

&amp;#x200B;

My advice for Nahum classes via analogy: When you first start to learn to talk, your grammar is obviously garbage, sentence structure, word usage, punctuation, inflection, etc. you basically do nothing correct when you first learn to speak, but you're speaking and that's what matters, you'll learn how to do it better later, but you just need to actually start. Same thing for this class, you learn how to code, you learn how to create c++ files and do basic things, but it's going to be garbage, you're going to want to remember how to code, but forget all of the strategies you learned in that class, other classes will teach you how to be a better programmer, but you need to know how to program first.",0.1156,0.3914,0.493
11136,"Currently taking online CSE 231 and here's my opinion... 


Not sure how you feel with coding in general but I had a slight background from community college. Overall I've enjoyed being online. The workload is the same every week making it easy to follow (Thurs: Pre-Lab, Fri: Lab, Sat: Chapter Exercises, Mon: Projects). For the first time I didn't finish a lab last week and while I didn't get full credit since I'm online I did get points for it. They don't make it all or nothing (Especially if you reach out to a TA). As an online student you're kind of on your own tho. I go to the help rooms every week to do the projects. Even if I don't need help, It's nice for when I get stuck to be able to get help. Relying on Piazza as an online student is horrific. If you can bring yourself to either go to the help rooms or be naturally good at coding... You'll be fine doing it online. After about halfway through the semester is when I started utilizing the help rooms. And to be very honest with you, If you're not a CS major... You can get through all the projects by going to the help room. You'd have to go to multiple times a week but they do truly help you there (Even with the long wait times).",0.6273,0.3146,0.0581
11137,"As a current CSE Junior at MSU this is how I see it. 

My choices of schooling were between Michigan Tech and MSU. I mainly chose MSU just for the area. 

Throughout High School and Community college everything was very easy to me. Teachers either taught in patterns that I could apply to tests or made classes too straightforward. At MSU I had a major wake up call. The freshman classes are definitely very easy. Once you start taking those CSE classes, like ""Somethinglessbad"" said, It's a lot of self teaching. I don't go to any of my classes anymore because I find my time is better spent teaching myself. A lot of the professors are good people but I do not find their teaching methods helpful. Overall I am happy with the program here. It's not easy but it does definitely force you to actually learn material which is the point of college. I remind myself that grades aren't everything and the classes aren't supposed to be easy. 

One thing I will add (not to scare you but to be open)... I would look into some reviews of Professor Nahum. I'd give an opinion but I have not had him yet and therefore don't have one. I feel professors who teach hard classes always get a bad reputation. He teaches a good amount of the CS classes and I've heard rough things about him.

11159,"Great summary! I Just wanted to add a little context here that might be helpful for folks who see this before/while taking 231 and 232. They are truly not intended to be weeder classes (i.e. they are not intended to be artificially hard to reduce the number of people in the major). I recognize that sometimes they can feel or even function like weeder classes, but the underlying reason for that is that they are super under-resourced.

I'm pointing this out not to be pedantic or defensive, but because I think understanding the actual problem probably makes the experience of taking these classes make more sense. These classes have one or two professors (who also have other responsibilities) and hundreds of students. Fundamentally that means that the professors' job is to lead an army of TAs, write assignments, and make sure the general course infrastructure doesn't crash and burn. In a good semester, maybe they can also work on overhauling one major aspect of the course. They don't have time to interact 1-on-1 with students that much, so they mostly have to leave that to TAs.

When the instructional staff of these classes seem like they're being obnoxiously strict, 99% of the time it's because they are enforcing a rule that is necessary for the class to be able to run at the required scale. When they tell you to watch the videos instead of giving you a quick 1-on-1 refresher of a given topic? It's because they don't have time to explain that topic 1-on-1 to 400 students (and it can be hard to tell when you actually watched the video and need a refresher vs. when you're trying to get away with not watching the videos). When they refuse to communicate any way other than through Piazza? It's because they need to keep their 100s of course-related communications in one place and they need the rest of the course staff to be able to help them answer questions whenever possible. When they won't give you an extension? It's because they have to draw a line about extensions that will be fair to all 400+ students and that won't require them to potentially enter 400 extensions into their records, because they do not have time to do that. When their answers to questions seem a little short or curt? It's because they're answering 100s of questions and trying to do so efficiently. When they ask leading questions or talk about study strategies instead of just giving you an answer? It's because they want to help you build the skills to succeed in the future.

The professors of these classes know that they could be doing so much better if they had more resources, and they hate that they don't. These problems are compounded by the fact that the material in these courses is super necessary for future courses, so if they let you pass without mastering it they are setting you up failure and also making things harder for those of us teaching upper level courses. Plus they are often constrained by the educational technology they have access to.

So what does this mean practically for folks taking 231 and 232? I'd suggest the following:

* When you ask questions, make sure you're putting it in the context of the course materials. For example, ""In video \[X\] you said \[Y\], but I was confused about how that connects to \[Z\]."" This will both make it clearer what part you don't understand and also make it clear that you actually watched the videos.
* Follow all of your professors' requests related to course logistics - they have developed a system that makes things manageable, but it only works if you cooperate.
* Remember that anything you ask for from the instructional staff needs to also be something they're willing to provide to the hundreds of other students in the class
* Remember that they are genuinely nice people and are doing the best they can to help you succeed given the constraints they're under. They wish things were different too. 

Context for OP: I am not trying to call out MSU's CS department in particular here. These are problems faced by CS departments at all large schools due to the constantly increasing number of people wanting to major in CS. Every school handles it differently. Some have strict GPA cut-offs to get into even the intro classes. Some have a lottery to get into intro classes. Some (like us) have huge intro classes that aren't as good as they would be if they had more resources. I honestly think that our approach is better than the first two, but they all have consequences.

11201,"Looks like you got some great places to check out from others recommendations! I just wanted to reiterate what some others have said:

Be mindful what you feed them! There‚Äôs plenty of great resources online but some of the replies have done a great job giving you examples! Peas and cracked corn are some favorites for waterfowl. Songbirds love various seeds (unsalted of course) and finely diced berries. If you‚Äôre trying to befriend the crows they‚Äôre quite fond of pistachios (again unsalted)! 

As for other animals on campus, you should always be more mindful and always hold some level of caution. I love the squirrels on campus, they‚Äôre fun little guys. But I also work with squirrels in a rehabilitation setting. I cannot emphasize enough to be cautious with squirrels! Even the friendliest squirrel can be angered over something and is not afraid to show it. Squirrels can carry some icky stuff including tetanus, also their bites hurt! So just be careful!

i ended up only taking one class this semester (the plan at first was to take zero but i decided i could handle one) due to ongoing severe mental health issues, and i receive a good amount of scholarship money that i didn‚Äôt want to waste. all it took was reaching out to my rcpd specialist (if you don‚Äôt have one, GET REGISTERED. it‚Äôs a lifesaver in so many ways) and the person in charge of my scholarships and they were able to pause them and document that the reason for my time off was medical. i don‚Äôt know your financial situation, nor do i need to; and the process is slightly different for people who have already started classes, but i do believe this qualifies for what i think is called medical exemption? i‚Äôm not entirely sure but i can look for resources if you‚Äôd like some. i know that in any case you will want to speak to your advisor first, and get registered with the RCPD if you can.

basically what i‚Äôm saying is that you aren‚Äôt on a one way track to probation or expulsion. there are provisions in place for these types of events and you will be okay. i do encourage you to reach out as soon as possible, though. the communication for these things can be rather tedious (making sure everyone who needs the information gets it, varied response times, etc.) but you‚Äôre going to feel so much better once that process is initiated. i wish you luck and please know that you can recover from this.",0.2843,0.5145,0.2013

To recover my GPA, I moved into a house off campus, took what classes I could transfer in from LCC to save money and because you get the actual instructor for 100-200 level courses at community colleges and the classes are smaller so I found for me it was easier to learn a subject in a small class environment.

11280,"Medical withdrawal is an option, but it's not necessarily as simple as ""talk to your advisor and you'll be fine"".  You'll likely have to stay on it for next semester as well; they're pretty serious about it being used for actual medical issues and making sure you're 100% ready to come back because they don't want students abusing the system to get out of bad grades.  You have to submit paperwork from your doctors both to apply for the leave and to apply to come back, and it gets reviewed by a committee of MSU doctors who decide if you really have a case.  Its also worth noting that you generally can only get medical withdrawal once, so you should think about if you really need it now or if you might have a more serious issue in the future.

Meanwhile, if you stay with what you've got now, you'll probably go on academic probation.  For that, you'll likely have to meet with a special advisor to go over how to get back into good standing.  Generally, this involves meeting with your program advisor to plan out your path to your degree, going to some workshops about how to be a good student, and getting good grades in that semester.  It's kind of a pain in the ass, but from the information you provided, it sounds like you probably won't have any problem setting yourself straight.

Hard narcotics are different because there is no societally acceptable amount and because the health effects after excessive use are unmitigatable and alcohol/tobacco are different because again, long-term excessive use will lead to irrevocable and terrible health effects.

And in the same way a ""sugar addicts/ food addicts"" support group where members just take turns describing their lack of sugar consumption and cheering each other on without discussing why they ate sugar all the time or spending time learning how to eat healthy would worry me as a place for eating disorders to grow, the exact same process but with pornography would seem to be a hotbed for issues with sexuality.

But it is the only place in the world to find Petoskey Stones, a fossil coral unique to Michigan. But you can also find other things! The Great Lakes, including Lake Michigan, are more mobile in the winter, so early in the spring you can find lots of things that have washed ashore from the lake, and you can find all kinds of things. And other people haven't traveled there yet, so you should have a good selection!
